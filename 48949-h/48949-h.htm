<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>The study of birds (and a most delightful
study too) is steadily on the increase,
and a great deal of good is being
done. A great deal more might be done
if older people would take more pains
in impressing upon all children never to
harm in any way our feathered friends.</p>
<p>I have prepared this little book of simple
true tales, not for the literary critic
to pull to pieces, but simply to give pleasure
to all lovers of pets, hoping it may
be of some help to those who wish to
tame and train their birds or cats.</p>
<p>I especially want it to teach children
to love and be kind to all living creatures
God has put upon the earth. He has
never put anything here that has not
<span class="pb" id="Page_VI">VI</span>
some use, no matter how some may fear
and hate the lower animals.</p>
<p>Never hurt anything, and only kill
when it is necessary, and then do it in
the quickest and most humane way.</p>
<p>I shall be glad to hear from any children
who have pets, and will aid them
all I can in taming and training them.</p>

<h1 title="">THE BIRD HOSPITAL</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">LITTLE BILLEE</span></h2>
<p>I have always been passionately fond
of animals, and would like to make pets
of them all. During the winter I keep
a free-lunch counter on my bedroom
window-sill for my little friends, the
English sparrows. Often there will be
two dozen partaking of the crumbs at
the same time, no two looking alike, and
making one think of a bootblack spread
in New York. Their table manners are
not always the best, I am sorry to say,
and there is often a great deal of cuffing,
scratching, and angry words.</p>
<p>When the first warm days of spring
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
come, they all say &ldquo;<i>bon jour</i>,&rdquo; but the
cold days of autumn bring them back in
full force, and it is like welcoming old
friends.</p>
<p>During the summer I keep a hospital,
and I have had some very curious cases.
The children bring in to me all of the
stray birds they find or take away from
cats. Often I have had ten at a time.
Some die from want of food when I
cannot make them eat, but more often
from wounds received from cats or
boys.</p>
<p>It is heartrending to have brought to
me a handsome pair of robins all torn
to pieces, and feel there is nothing I can
do to save their lives, when I know their
babies in the nests are crying for food,
and will soon die from starvation.</p>
<p>My hospital really opened one June
by my mother picking up off the front
sidewalk a little brown bird which could
not have been more than two weeks old.
I had been ill many months, and my
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
mother and friends had done all they
could to make the days pass as quickly
as possible for me. So when my mother
saw the little orphan, she put him in her
handkerchief and brought him to my
room, thinking it might amuse me, and
I took him inside the bed. After an
hour he seemed very happy and not at
all afraid.</p>
<p>I looked him over carefully, but found
him uninjured. I took him to an open
window, expecting to see him try to fly
away, but he did not seem to have the
slightest intention of doing so.</p>
<p>The first day I could not get him to
eat anything until night, when he drank
milk from an after-dinner coffee-spoon.
After that he took little pieces of bread
soaked in milk from my tongue or lips.
I fed him in that way for several days,
then he would take it out of my fingers.
He lived on bread and milk for two
weeks; after that he ate anything I did,&mdash;all
kinds of vegetables, mushrooms,
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
and ice-cream. He liked to sit on my
shoulder and take his food off my fork.</p>
<p>I had some kind of nourishment every
two hours, and Little Billee knew very
well when my maid came to my room
with a salver that there was something
on it to eat or drink, and he was wild
until he could get on my hand or shoulder.
He drank milk from my tumbler,
and would not drink water out of anything
but my medicine glass. When
Little Billee would see me sit down in
the morning with an orange on a plate,
he&rsquo;d fly upon his cage, then over into
my lap, and sit on the first finger of my
left hand, and eat the orange from my
spoon. At first he could not crack his
own seeds, and, as he was very fond of
them, I used to do it for him. Later he
could crack them himself, but preferred
eating them outside his cage, and his
hemp seed he would always bring over
and eat on the rug in front of my
bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>He was very fond of little orange-blossom
biscuit. I kept some in a tin
box under a table by the side of my bed.
For several days, every time I would
reach out of bed and tap on the box,
Little Billee would come running for a
piece. One day I was visiting with a
friend, and we forgot all about the bird.
Soon we heard rap, tap, tap, peep,
peep, peep, and there was Little Billee
standing by the box waiting for a piece.
After that he would come many times
a day. If I sent him away with a small
piece, he would return directly for a
large one.</p>
<p>I had quite a time teaching him to
stay in his cage. The first day I put
him in, I was afraid he would die of
fright, and I left the cage on the floor
for two days before he ventured in.
After he had been going in and out for
some time, I closed the door, but he was
frightened quite as much as at first, and
he would not go near the cage the rest
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
of the day. Finally I tried taking the
cage on my lap and shutting him in; he
did not seem afraid then, and soon he did
not mind being shut up in the morning
when I was in my dressing-room, but he
much preferred going in and out at his
own sweet will. If I left him shut up
in his cage and went back to bed, he was
frantic until he was let out, and would
then get in bed with me. For the first
two weeks he was not happy if he was
not on me somewhere. He would stay
in bed with me for hours at a time, but
when he became more accustomed to
the house he would play on the floor
with a little piece of paper, cotton, or
a ribbon, and eat his seeds and biscuit.</p>
<p>I dress my hair high, and it was Little
Billee&rsquo;s special delight to sit on the top
of my twist while I walked about my
room. During the first few weeks, if
I put him on the floor when he had been
in bed with me, he would hop back and
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
forth on the rug in front of my bed, and
beg to be taken, as he could not fly
straight up. I would put down my hand,
he would hop upon my finger, and in a
second be back inside the bed. If I was
sitting in a chair, and put him down on
the floor, he would climb right up from
my feet to my neck, put his little bill
in my mouth, and chirp with glee. One
day he was on the floor, and did not see
me go back to bed, but saw my wrapper
over a chair which stood about a yard
from my bed. He supposed I was inside
of it, but, when he reached the top
and found no mouth to put his bill into,
he gave several very mournful peeps,
but, as soon as I spoke to him, he chirped,
and it did not take him long to fly over
to me. The next day when I put him
down on the floor, I was anxious to see
what he would do. After teasing for
some time for me to take him, he went
to the chair, climbed up on the wrapper
until he reached the top, then flew over
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
to me. Ever after he came that way
when I refused to take him.</p>
<p>One day I left Little Billee on the rug
in front of the bed, and went into my
dressing-room. While I was gone, my
mother came in and sat down. He was
much frightened. Every time she spoke
to him, he ran under the bed, stuck his
little head out from under the valance
and peeped for me to come to him.
When I spoke, he answered, but he was
too much afraid to pass mother to come
to me. When I came out, he ran quickly
to me and flew on to the back of a very
low chair. I bent down and he flew
up on my shoulder, chirping as loud as
he could. No little child could have
shown more joy in getting back to its
mother. I do not suppose he remembered
any other mother, and thought all little
birds have just such good mothers as I.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>I have a magnificent big tiger cat
named Taffy, so I thought Little Billee
would be a very good name for my wee
bird. It seemed a very appropriate name,
too, as he spent a great deal of his time
dressing himself and manicuring his nails.
When he would strut about with his head
held high, you could plainly see the long
coat, high collar, high hat, and umbrella,
and could easily imagine the original
Little Billee was before you. But I am
sorry to say Taffy and my Little Billee
would never go walking arm in arm together.
Twice Taffy caught Little
Billee, but I rescued him from the jaws
of death before any harm was done, and
I tried my best to get them to live contentedly
together. I would not allow
Little Billee to go out into the hall, for
fear he would fly down-stairs and be
caught by Taffy before any one could
reach him. Before the door into the
hall is a small rug, and he thought flying
over that a great feat, but when I would
say: &ldquo;Little Billee, come right home,&rdquo;
he would return instantly.</p>
<p>He went to bed at eight o&rsquo;clock in a
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
little basket, which I put on the top of
some hanging shelves, so there would be
no danger from Taffy in the dark.
Taffy slept on my bed every night, and
very often on the outside when Little
Billee was inside, and it seemed like the
lion and the lamb lying down together.
Little Billee would usually be contented
in his basket until seven o&rsquo;clock in the
morning; then I&rsquo;d take him into the bed
with me, where he would lie quietly on
my arm, neck, or palm until I got up
at nine. He never peeped unless I spoke
to him, then he would chirp away like a
happy child. On fine evenings I&rsquo;d sit
before an open window from seven until
eight o&rsquo;clock with Little Billee on my
finger listening to the birds. When he
became sleepy, he would tuck his little
head under his wing, and in a few minutes
crawl into the palm of my hand and
go sound asleep; then he would be ready
for his basket.</p>
<p>When the hot wave came, I went
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
down-stairs at seven o&rsquo;clock, shutting
him up in his cage. The second night
I had hard work to catch him. He ran
into the hall, and would not come when
I called to him. The third night, when
he saw me making preparations to dress,
he acted like mad. He hopped all
around me, put out his tiny wings, and
tried to fly on to me; opened his bill,
but not a sound came out. As I stood
in front of my dressing-table, he flew to
the top of his cage, which stood on the
floor, to the back of a chair which was
near me, then up to my shoulder, chirping
away so merrily that I knew he was
saying: &ldquo;Please take me with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, after that, it is needless to
say that I took him down-stairs, and he
went down every night after, where he
remained until eight o&rsquo;clock, then was
put into his basket, and I heard no more
from him until morning.</p>
<p>On pleasant mornings I sat on the
piazza, and Little Billee sat on my hand
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
or played in my lap. When I walked on
the sidewalk Little Billee went, too, and
never offered to fly away, and when the
wind blew he held on tight. Sometimes
he sang, and always seemed interested
in all that was going on about him.</p>
<p>Twice Little Billee flew out of my
window from fright. Once he was on
my shoulder when a very small girl with
a very large hat came up to him, and
away he flew. The next time a large
bunch of ferns was brought to me. I
thought he would like it and think it a
nice little tree, but I was all the tree he
seemed to care for. He was so frightened
he flew on to a chair, and, as I held
up a fern, out of the window he went.
Both times when my maid went to look
for him, she could not find him until she
peeped, then he answered, and she found
him sitting in the grass waiting to be
picked up, and he was delighted to get
back to me.</p>
<p>Little Billee never went to any one
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
except my physician, and that was when
I had had him about a week. He went
to him, hopped all over his shoulder,
picked at his collar and tie, and was very
friendly. Later he would not even go to
him, and I felt sure I was Trilby, and his
only love. Perhaps the children who
read this will think Little Billee was
an angel bird and too good to live, but
I will say right here he was too bad to
die. Like all bright children, sometimes
he was very naughty. For instance,
when I wanted to lie quietly on my bed
in the daytime and Little Billee did not,
he would play for some time running up
on the top of my pillow, then down
again, hop on my arm, then under the
sheet until he found my hand; back he
would go and do the same thing over
again. When he became tired of that,
he would sit on my chin and be very
loving, kiss me in the mouth, and chirp
away. When he found I was not going
to open my eyes or speak to him, he
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
would peck and bite my eyes, nose, ears,
cheeks, and lips, and I assure you they
were not love bites, either. Then again,
when he wanted to sit on my shoulder
and I preferred he should sit on my
hand, he would fly up every time I took
him down, and bite hard at my hand,
and, for such a little bird, he had a very
big bite and a very fierce look.</p>
<p>He loved to visit my mother in her
room, and was very happy walking all
over her and on her head, but she was
never able to touch him. He seemed to
have eyes all over his head, for, no matter
how careful she was, he always saw the
finger. He thoroughly enjoyed my
squeezing him in my hand, and kissing
him over and over again.</p>
<p>No doubt, long ere this, my readers
have been wondering what kind of a bird
Little Billee was, but that is a question
which has not yet been answered. But
I loved Little Billee so dearly that it
made little difference to me what his nationality
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
was, or whether his ancestors
came over in the Mayflower, fought in
the American Revolution, or whether,
like Topsy, he &ldquo;just growed.&rdquo; It was
amusing to see Little Billee the first time
he heard the piano. One morning two
friends came to see me, and, while one
of them played, I lay on the sofa with
Little Billee cuddled up on my neck. At
first he was very much afraid, and did
not know what to make of the music.
Soon he became charmed, and craned his
little neck way out, opened his bill, as if
he were drinking in the sound, then
reached around, kissed me in the mouth,
snuggled down again for a few minutes,
and repeated it as long as she played.</p>
<p>One morning I saw Little Billee lying
on the floor before an open window with
his neck stretched out and bill wide open.
I thought he was dying, picked him up,
but found him as lively as ever. When
he did the same thing over again, I
understood he was taking a sun bath,
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
and from then on he took one every
morning. One morning it was quite cold
when we came in from our walk, and I
sat down in front of the fire with Little
Billee on my knee. It was amusing to
see him put his head on one side, open
his bill, and drink in the warm air. For
six weeks he strongly objected to taking
a water bath, and I really suppose he
was too young and knew best. I left a
little dish for several days on the floor
by the side of his cage, but he was very
careful not to go near it. One morning
everything was very quiet, I on my bed
and Little Billee playing about the room.
Soon he went to the dish, looked in all
four corners, came back to the first one,
put his bill in just a little way, then went
the rounds; did it all over again, putting
his bill in a little farther, and shaking
off the water. After debating a long
time, he got on the edge of the dish, put
his head in until it was all wet, then
screwed up all his courage and in he
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
went. Such a droll little figure as he
cut, standing there with his body and
head held as high as he could get them,
his wings out just a little, not knowing
what to do next. All I could think of
was a very timid child going in wading
for the first time, with long, thin legs,
very short frock, and arms akimbo. His
fear soon left him, and he was bathing
like an old stager. When he finished,
he got out, gave himself two or three
good shakes, then came over to the bed,
and asked me to take him. I did him
up in my handkerchief, but that did not
suit him at all. I could not do anything
with him until I let him get on my bare
neck, and covered him with the trimming
of my dress. He was soaking wet, and
shivering like a person having a hard
chill. He kept very still until his feathers
were dry enough to be dressed.
Such shaking, dressing of feathers, and
prinking I never saw. When his toilet
was made to suit him, he nestled down
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
under my chin, and we both slept for
an hour. Every day we went through
the same performance after the bath.
One day I wanted to do something in
my dressing-room, so thought Little
Billee could take his bath and dry himself.</p>
<p>Soon I began to hear very mournful
peeps, and I came out to find Little
Billee, soaking wet, standing in front of
my bed, thinking I was there, and teasing
for me to take him. Of course I
could not resist such pleading, so to bed
we went. I know I completely spoiled
him, but he was such a dear no one could
help it.</p>
<p>Little Billee always took a great interest
in my writing, and when I would sit
down to my desk he was always on my
shoulder, arm, or hand. His favourite
place to sit was on my left hand between
my first finger and thumb, as they held
my portfolio on my lap, and peck at my
paper and pen. One day he took the
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
pen full of ink into his bill, then threw
the ink all over my paper. He had great
fun, too, in taking the paper off from
the bottom of his cage, and carrying it
all about the room, and would take it out
as fast as I put it in. One day he went
into his cage, took the farthest corner
of the paper in his bill, backed out, bringing
the paper over his head until it was
all on the floor, then went over to the
opposite corner, took that in his bill,
backed off the paper until he came to
the end, then went around in a circle like
the wind for perhaps a dozen times, with
the paper perfectly straight out just like
a sail. After a few moments I put the
paper back; he took it right out in the
same way, and did it all over again.</p>
<p>Another day he would not come to me
when I put down my hand, but ran across
the room. After trying for some time to
make him mind, I got up and said:
&ldquo;Billee, I am going away and leave
you,&rdquo; and started out into the hall. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
came chasing after me, and after that
would always do it when I told him I
was going to leave him. If I went out
of my room and told him he <i>must not</i>
go, he would sit on a chair by an open
window, or play about on the floor for
an hour, and never think of flying out
of the window or going out of the door.</p>
<p>I succeeded far beyond my expectations
with Taffy and Little Billee. It
hurt me very much to be obliged to punish
Taffy when he would spring at Little
Billee, as Taffy and I had been devoted
to each other for two years; still I did
not want him to kill my baby bird. One
day Little Billee was sitting on my knee
dressing his feathers and going through
all sorts of antics, while Taffy sat a few
feet away, gazing at him with longing
eyes. I called to my maid to bring Taffy
and hold him on her lap, and then let
Little Billee peck and bite his paws, ears,
and nose, and a more astonished cat I
never saw. After we let Taffy go, he
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
was found sitting on the cellar stairs in
a most dejected way, rubbing his nose
with his paw. For several days we did
the same thing, until Taffy was afraid at
the sight of Little Billee. One morning
Taffy came to bed with me, and lay on
my arm, while Little Billee sat on my
shoulder. Soon Taffy put his chin on
my chin, and Little Billee came and sat
close to my cheek. Finally Taffy became
so sleepy, he turned over, went fast
asleep, and Little Billee hopped down
on his back, and we lay that way for
some time. Almost every day after that
Taffy would lie on my lap, and Little
Billee would sit on his head, back, or on
my knee, and dress his feathers. One
day Little Billee had the impertinence,
while I had them both on my lap, to
reach out and peck Taffy in the eye.
That was a little more than Taffy could
endure, and he reached out his paw and
struck at him. I could not get Little
Billee to go near him for over a week,
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
when they became very good friends
again.</p>
<p>Little Billee enjoyed going down into
the parlours to see visitors, but he gave
them to understand, the first thing, they
might look but not touch. He would entertain
them by hopping all over me,
kissing me in the mouth, and chirping
at the top of his voice.</p>
<p>When it began to get dark, Little
Billee did not want to be off from me
a minute. If I had him down-stairs, and
put him on the floor, he would hop and
fly after me from room to room. Once
I left him in the front parlour on a
plant-jar, and went into the dining-room
and was gone some little time. When
I came back there was no Little Billee
to be found. I called him by name and
peeped to him, but I could not get an
answer. As I went up-stairs, I called:
&ldquo;Where is my Little Billee?&rdquo; And he
said: &ldquo;Chirp, chirp, chirp,&rdquo; and I found
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
him in my room eating his seeds and as
happy as possible.</p>
<p>From then on, whenever he became
tired of the parlours, he would go up-stairs,
for he seemed to think my room
his home. One day I watched him to
see how he went. He hopped from step
to step. When he reached the top, he
flew into my room and lighted on the
top of his cage.</p>
<p>Sometimes he waited for me at the
top of the stairs, lying flat down, putting
his head out just as a dog does his between
his paws.</p>
<p>Little Billee certainly was not colour-blind,
for he noticed every little change
in my dress, no matter how slight it was.
He had seen me for weeks in only my
<i>robe de nuit</i> and wrapper. It was pitiable
to see him the first time he saw me
gowned in a white skirt and blue waist.
I had to lie down when I had finished
dressing, and Little Billee came over
to the bed as usual and asked me to take
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
him. I put down my hand, he hopped
on my finger, but, when he looked up
and saw the blue sleeve, away he went
as if he had been shot out of a cannon.
He tried several times, but his courage
always failed. At last he gave up and
went and sat in a chair across the room,
and it was two days before he really liked
the change.</p>
<p>Next I tried a pink waist with the
white skirt, but that seemed even worse
to him, which seemed very strange, as
he had seen me for days in a pink and
white wrapper.</p>
<p>One morning in November, I was trying
my strength by doing a little dusting,
after getting Little Billee&rsquo;s cage ready
for the day. He was unusually happy
and lively, but thought it was high time
we went back to bed, so kept flying from
the top of his cage, which was near me,
to the bed and back again, teasing me
to go with him.</p>
<p>He was always afraid of anything
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
white, and, not thinking, as he flew back
to me, I picked up my large cheese-cloth
duster by one end and spread the rest
out like a flag. The window and blinds
were wide open, and to get out of the
way of the cloth, he flew out the window,
probably not having the least idea
where he was going. I called to our maid
to run across the street and look for him,
thinking he had gone that way.</p>
<p>After she had looked an hour, we were
told of a little brown bird that had been
seen in the next yard sitting in the dry
leaves. They said he seemed very tame,
and looked as if he expected some one
to come and pick him up. We were
positive that it was our lost pet, but we
could not find any further trace of him.</p>
<p>That night it grew very cold and
rained hard until morning, and we have
not a doubt that he perished, as he had
always been used to his nice warm basket.</p>
<p>For days we were a very sad household,
and many tears were shed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">TAFFY AND TRICKSEY</span></h2>
<p>I can hardly call Taffy a patient, as
he is so well and strong. Perhaps an
attendant would be more suitable, as he
is always in the hospital, looking after
the patients, and nothing goes on that
he does not see, but Tricksey is suffering
from the asthma.</p>
<p>Taffy is the largest tiger cat I have
ever seen, and, as he has the crook in his
tail, he belongs to the tabby breed. Taffy
is very large, usually weighing fourteen
pounds, but he has a very small head
and very small, finely shaped paws. The
under parts of them look like black velvet.
In colour he is mostly jet-black, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
the other fur, very much like a raccoon&rsquo;s,
light tan at the ends, shading into yellow,
then into drab. As the sun strikes him,
every hair seems full of light, and he is
one mass of iridescent colours. His
marking is most beautiful. The top of
his head is black, branching out into five
narrow black stripes down his neck, a
black stripe three inches wide (without
one light hair) going all the way down
the back and to the end of the tail
and under; of course, on the tail the
stripe is much narrower. Then narrow
black stripes go down each side of
his back and tail. His tail is not long,
but very bushy, like a nice boa. I never
saw more exquisite colouring and marking
than Taffy has underneath, from his
throat to his tail. His coat is beautifully
soft and thick, and shines like satin, and
his eyes are very green. He is particular
about his toilet, but insists upon my helping
him to keep it glossy. His own comb
is kept on my dressing-table, and he asks
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
me to comb him twice a day, and sometimes
oftener.</p>
<p>I can tell you nothing of Taffy&rsquo;s antecedents,
as I found him one morning in
our back yard almost starved to death,
and about as thick through the body as
a shingle. At first I thought he had
dropped from heaven, but I soon learned
from his sayings and doings that he must
have been quite intimate with the inmates
of the lower region. I tempted him
with chicken, but it was some little time
before I could put my hand on him;
and, to tame any animal, you must be
able to touch it with your hand. After
two or three pats, he seemed to realize
that I was a good friend. Soon I had
him in the house, and for three years
we have been devoted to each other. I
have had a great many cats, but never
one who had so much of the wild animal
in him. All of my friends said I never
could tame Taffy, and it was many weeks
before I had much influence over him,
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
and I never feel quite sure now whether
I am to be loved or scratched, as he still
has the temper and the actions of a tiger
when anything goes the wrong way.</p>
<p>He usually lies down like a tiger, with
legs straight out in front, tail straight
out behind, and when I speak to him
he will always blink his eyes and speak
to me. If you touch him in passing,
he will grab at your feet and spit and
growl. He never mews when he wants
anything to eat, but will chase me or
my maid, and grab at our feet. If he
does not like what is given him to eat,
he will walk all about his plate, and
scratch, as if he were covering it up.</p>
<p>I am the only one Taffy ever shows
much affection for, but to me he is very
loving. He will lie as long as I will
let him with his paws about my neck
and head on my shoulder. If he is
sound asleep anywhere, and I begin to
read aloud, sing, or whistle, he will get
up directly, jump on my lap, put his
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
paws about my neck, his face close to
mine, and begin to purr. As he always
looks very pleasant, I flatter myself he
likes the tone of my voice.</p>
<p>When I had my bird, Little Billee,
it would make Taffy simply furious if
I put him out of my room and closed the
door. One morning he was so ugly, my
maid did not dare open the door to come
in.</p>
<p>After that, when I wanted him to go
down-stairs, I had my maid come to the
bottom of the stairs and call, &ldquo;Taffy!&rdquo;
then there was never any trouble. When
he is in a tearing rage, I can always quiet
him by taking tight hold of his paws,
and kissing his eyes. I have told all of
these things about Taffy so my readers
will appreciate what I have been able to
do with him. It is needless to say that
when Little Billee went away, Taffy was
the happiest cat in town. His devotion
increased daily to me, and he lived in my
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
room, only going down to get something
to eat.</p>
<p>I think by this time you are very well
acquainted with Mr. Taffy, and I will
present Tricksey to you. Of all the
canary birds I have ever seen, Tricksey
is the prettiest, daintiest little bird you
can possibly imagine. His colour is light
yellow, with a much deeper shade between
his wings, shading into almost an
orange. His wings and tail are white,
with just a line of yellow on some of the
feathers. His eyes are unusually large
and bright, and his little legs and claws
are very pink, and so slender that they
do not look strong enough to support
his finely shaped body. He is really a
very superior bird, and sings like an
angel.</p>
<p>Tricksey had never been out of his
cage when he came to me, but, before I
had had him a week, he came out, perched
on my finger, took things from my finger
or mouth, would kiss me, and go all about
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
my room on my finger, and very soon
went all about the house with me. He
was very fond of sweet apple, but I
never let him have it inside his cage, but
made him come to me for it. I kept a
piece in a little dish on my table, and
he soon found out where it was, and
would help himself on the sly. I also
kept on my table, in a little china cup,
some hemp seed, which I gave to Tricksey
as a great treat. Every time I would
tap on the cup and make it ring, Tricksey
would come out of his cage, down
from a picture-frame, or wherever he
was, for a seed.</p>
<p>One day he had had his one hemp seed,
and teased for more, but I said, &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
and he went flying about the room, having
a fine time. Soon he flew back on
the table, hopped over to the cup, gave
it two or three taps to make it ring, then
hopped on to the top, reached down and
helped himself to two seeds.</p>
<div class="img" id="pica3">
<img src="images/i049.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="500" />
<p class="caption">TRICKSEY</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Tricksey is a very vain little bird, and
likes nothing better than to go over on
my dressing-table, walk back and forth
in front of the mirror, or sit on my pin-cushion
and admire himself.</p>
<p>Tricksey came to me one afternoon,
and Taffy knew nothing of his arrival
until the next morning. When he came
up-stairs and saw a little yellow bird in
a house of gold, he was like the little
girl&rsquo;s Bunnie, who &ldquo;was not a bit afraid,
but awfully much surprised,&rdquo; when she
heard firecrackers for the first time. His
eyes were like balls of fire, while his
mouth opened and shut, making a hissing
sound, and his tail going at the rate of
a mile a minute. He walked into my
room like a wild tiger, with an air as
much as to say, &ldquo;If this is Little Billee
come back dressed in yellow, die he
must,&rdquo; and sprang at the cage. I took
him firmly by the paws, looked straight
into his big, angry eyes, and said in a
soft, firm voice: &ldquo;Taffy, this is Tricksey,
and he is not to be eaten or hurt
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
any more than my Little Billee who went
away.&rdquo; I let go of his paws; he walked
out of my room and down-stairs without
looking back. In about an hour I looked
out into the hall, and there sat my dear
old Taffy on the top step, looking very
meek and wishful. I spoke kindly to
him, and asked him to come in and see his
new brother, Tricksey. After a few
moments, he came in very slowly and
went behind my bed. Soon he came
from under the valance (the cage sat on
a chair and I in front of it), never
looked at the cage, jumped into my lap,
put his paws about my neck, and began
loving me. I took him to bed with me,
and he never moved until Tricksey began
to sing in a most delightful way, then
he looked at him and listened very intently.
I talked to him, and &ldquo;softed his
feathers,&rdquo; and soon he snuggled down in
my arm and went to sleep. When he got
out of bed, he never glanced at the cage,
but went directly down-stairs, and I felt
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
I had made a good beginning. Every
one said I could never teach Taffy not
to catch Tricksey, and the reason his cat-ship
did not kill Little Billee was because
he was afraid of him and so carefully
watched. I knew there was not
a place in the house I could hang the
cage where Taffy could not get at it if
he made up his mind to do so. Of course,
for days and weeks I felt anxious, and
did not mean to leave them alone together.
I never turned Taffy out of my
room. If he went up to the cage and
put up his paw, I would say: &ldquo;Taffy,
you must <i>not</i> put your paw on the cage,&rdquo;
and, as he always minds, he would take
it right down, sit by the cage, and I
would talk to him kindly. Fortunately,
Tricksey was not at all afraid of Taffy.</p>
<p>Taffy always wears a yellow satin collar
with bells all around. Often I would
hear him coming up-stairs when I was
lying down, and I would keep very quiet
to see what he would do. Sometimes he
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
would come over to the cage, look at
Tricksey pleasantly, then lie down by the
fire and go to sleep; more often he
would lie down without even looking at
him. But the moment he heard me talking
to Tricksey, he would get up and
come to me to be petted, and I always
gave him a great deal. One day when
Taffy was in another room, I let Tricksey
out, and tried to be very quiet. I
was sitting on the floor with Tricksey
hopping about me. Before I hardly
knew it, Taffy was in my lap, and soon
I had Tricksey on my knee eating seeds.
If I took the cage on my lap with Tricksey
inside, Taffy would immediately
jump up and crowd in between the cage
and me.</p>
<p>Taffy was very much afraid the first
time he saw Tricksey take his bath, and
ran under the bed and peeped out from
under the valance.</p>
<p>One morning the cage sat on the floor,
and Tricksey was ready for his bath,
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
when Taffy came in and sat close to the
cage. Tricksey took a big drop of water
in his bill and threw it into Taffy&rsquo;s face.
Taffy moved back a little, and looked
all about to see where it came from.
While he was looking, Tricksey went into
his bath, and splashed the water all over
Taffy&rsquo;s face in a very roguish way. To
say Taffy was surprised is speaking
mildly. He turned to me with an angry
cry and went out of the room. The next
morning the same thing happened; but,
instead of going out of the room, he
went on the other side, out of reach of
the water, but where he could see all that
went on.</p>
<p>After that, he became so interested he
did not mind if the water was splashed
all over his face, and would sit as close
to the cage as he could get. While
Tricksey was eating his breakfast, he
would lie down close to the cage and go
to sleep. As I previously said, I never
meant to leave Taffy in the room with
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
Tricksey, but he was often there hours
before I knew it. When I found him,
he was always asleep in front of the cage
or by the fire.</p>
<p>One morning, after the bath, I put the
cage up in the window. Taffy did not
seem to like it at all. He looked at me
most wishfully, and began talking cat
language, and I knew he was saying:
&ldquo;Please put Tricksey back on the floor.&rdquo;
I did so, and Taffy began to purr, lay
down with his back close to the cage,
stretched out, and went to sleep.</p>
<p>He had been lying that way for an
hour when some visitors came. It seemed
too bad to disturb Taffy, so I left him,
and thought I would risk it.</p>
<p>Two hours passed before I went back,
and you may imagine my delight when
I found my two boys (so different in
colour, size, and disposition) as happy as
two kittens. Tricksey was singing merrily.
Taffy had wakened, changed his
position, and looked as if he felt very
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
proud, being left to take care of his small
brother. His eyes were as soft as velvet,
and he spoke to me in a soft, cooing
tone. Since then I have never felt there
was any danger in leaving them together.
I regret to say Tricksey has a strong
will of his own, and almost as bad a
temper as Taffy.</p>
<p>At different times I had three wee
baby birds brought in to me, but they all
died. Tricksey was very jealous of them,
and when he saw me feeding them, he
would become very angry, beat his wings
against his cage, and beg for me to let
him out. One day I put one of the little
strangers on the floor and let Tricksey
out. He flew at the waif and tore feathers
out of the top of his head. I took
the poor little frightened thing in my
hand. Tricksey flew on my finger and
pecked him. I put him in my other hand,
and Tricksey flew at him more angry
than ever. Then I put him on the floor,
and Tricksey was so happy he flew on
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
my head, hopped about my shoulders,
and kissed me in the mouth. In the
middle of the performance in walked
dignified Mr. Taffy, with a look which
plainly said: &ldquo;What more are you going
to bring into this room?&rdquo; He sat by
my side looking at the newcomer, and,
before I knew what he was going to do,
reached out his paw, and gave him a
good slap, which sent him off my lap
on to the floor.</p>
<p>Early in the fall, before I had any
fire in my room, I would bring Tricksey
down in the morning and keep him until
evening, and for two weeks Taffy never
went near my room during the day, but
stayed down there with Tricksey. The
first day I had a fire in my room, I did
not bring Tricksey down as usual. After
I gave Taffy his luncheon, I missed
him, but did not go to my room until
five o&rsquo;clock, and there was faithful Taffy
sound asleep close to Tricksey&rsquo;s cage, and
now he stays in my room all day. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
has plainly shown that, if Tricksey stays
there, he stays, too.</p>
<p>I find that animals want to be treated
very much like children. The more intelligent
they are, the easier it is to influence
them, and the quicker they are to
read you. First give them a great deal
of love and kindness, always be firm,
very patient, and above all <i>never</i> deceive
them in the most trivial thing.</p>

<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">DEWEY</span></h2>
<p>One morning my mother called to me,
saying: &ldquo;Here comes Charlotte with a
bird.&rdquo; I wondered at first whether my
little friend was bringing me another
sparrow, but, when I saw him, I could
not help exclaiming: &ldquo;What a perfect
beauty!&rdquo; And the way he cuddled down
in my hand immediately won my heart.</p>
<p>He was straightway named Dewey,
but what kind of bird he was, I never
found out. Some people said he was an
oriole, others a meadow-lark, while others
not a meadow-lark, but some kind of a
lark. Again he seemed a little like a
blue jay, and, in fact, had points like
a dozen different kinds of birds. When
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
he was first brought to me, he was evidently
about six weeks old, quite large
and fluffy, but very much of a baby, for
he knew nothing about feeding himself.</p>
<p>His tail was long, olive on top, yellow
underneath; wings black, with cream colour
on the edges: on the lower feathers
just a line, on the upper ones quite a
little wider, at the top short yellow feathers,
making lovely little scallops; head
and back olive-brown; rump more on the
yellow, with a tinge of blue under the
wings, and belly only tinted. As he grew
older, he kept changing, and when nine
months old his breast was light orange,
belly light yellow, head and back deeper
olive, rump deeper yellow. At one time
he broke his tail off, and when it came
in, the upper feathers were black, with
yellow a quarter of an inch at the rump,
while the under feathers were yellow and
black. On his head were almost invisible
stripes of black, and on his neck pretty
broken, wavy ones. His eyes were large
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
and bright, and his bill, so every one
said, was the handsomest they had ever
seen, it was so very long, and pointed as
a needle. Underneath it was ivory-white,
and on top black, with a white star at
the head. But the admiration of all were
his legs and claws, as he kept them so
clean, and they were a beautiful blue,
just the shade of malachite. He was
seven inches long, and when nearly a year
old began getting black spots over his
eyes and on his throat. Now, what kind
of a bird was he? Do you know? At
any rate, I know he was a little rogue,
and an imp for getting in mischief.</p>
<p>When he was given me, I installed him
right away as an inmate of my hospital,
where I then had two birds, Tricksey, a
beautiful canary, and Cervera, a dirt-coloured
sort of bird, with big, staring
eyes and a bill almost as large as his
head, which was perfectly flat. He was
about the size of the canary, but only had
his baby feathers and one tail feather.
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
Surely, he was not a handsome bird, and
I could not blame Dewey for never liking
him.</p>
<p>When night came, I tried putting
Dewey in the cage with Tricksey and
Cervera, but Cervera pecked at him so
much, and made poor Dewey&rsquo;s life so
miserable, I had to take Cervera out, and
make him sleep in a basket by himself.
Tricksey and Dewey, however, became
great friends, and immediately put their
wings close together and went to sleep.</p>
<p>In the morning, when the birds were
let out on the floor, it was amusing to see
Cervera mimic everything Tricksey did.
If Tricksey took a drink, Cervera would,
and would follow everywhere he went.
When Dewey saw Taffy coming into
the room for the first time, every nerve
quivered with fright, as he did not know
what that huge striped thing with shining
green eyes was. Tricksey stood near
Dewey, and I feel sure he whispered in
his ear: &ldquo;You need not be at all afraid;
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
that is only Taffy, the cat, and we are
the best of friends,&rdquo; for after that he
never had the least fear of Taffy. Taffy
jumped into my lap, the three birds stood
on the table, and I fed them by turns
their bread and milk.</p>
<p>I soon found Dewey was a great mischief.
One morning I left him loose
in my room, and, on my return, what a
sight greeted my eyes! He had taken
all the pins and anything he could pick
up, and thrown them on the floor. He
had overturned a basket filled with ribbons
and lace; some of the ribbons he
had left on the floor, while with others
he had decorated his cage, and in the cage
I found a pair of heavy sleeve links,
which he had thrown in his drinking-cup,
while on the floor of the cage were two
large coral hairpins, two shell pins, some
studs, and another pair of cuff-buttons.</p>
<p>For a moment I stood speechless, then
said: &ldquo;You rogue of a bird, how shall I
punish you?&rdquo; But I did not have the
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
heart to punish him, and, taking him in
my hand, kissed him again and again.</p>
<p>When Tricksey had the asthma very
badly, sometimes a little whiskey on some
sugar would relieve him. It was funny
to see Cervera man&oelig;uvre to get Tricksey
off the perch, so he could eat the sugar
and whiskey himself. Tricksey, however,
I am sorry to say, grew worse instead of
better, and one morning I was awakened
early by his hard breathing. I took him
off his perch, and found his claws ice-cold.
He lay in my hand a few moments,
pitifully gasping for breath, then
threw back his pretty head, and all was
over. We were heart-broken, and shed
many tears, for we were powerless to
bring back to life that little bird we loved
so dearly.</p>
<p>I really felt sorry for Cervera. I believe
he missed Tricksey, and for days
seemed to be looking for him. One evening,
like a flash, he flew out of the
window, and I was never able to find him
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
again. From then on, I could give more
time to Dewey, as he was my only visitor
left in the hospital.</p>
<p>One day, when I had him in the dining-room,
I gave him a piece of sweet
apple, which he seemed to enjoy immensely.
The next morning Dewey was
missing, and I looked for him everywhere
up-stairs, as he had never gone
down-stairs by himself, but he was nowhere
to be found. At last I happened
to go down in the dining-room, and there,
quiet as a mouse, he sat on the sideboard,
eating his fill of apple. After that,
when he wanted anything down-stairs,
he went for it himself.</p>
<p>He loved grapes better than any other
fruit, and, no matter where he was, if I
only said, &ldquo;Dewey, would you like a
grape?&rdquo; he would fly to me, light on my
finger, and go with me into the closet
for one. One morning I again thought
he was lost, but he was found safely in
the dark closet eating a grape. When he
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
wanted one, he would hop back and forth
on the back parlour table, then on top
of a high-back chair, and tease until one
was given him. He liked best to have
me hold a grape in my right hand, while
he perched on my left, when he would
suck all the rich, sweet juice next the
skin first, then he would take the pulp
over on a table and knock it until all
the seeds came out before he ate it.</p>
<p>He liked flies, too, but spiders were
his especial treat, and when he saw me
with my handkerchief done up in my
hand, he seemed to know what was inside,
and would light on my finger, open the
handkerchief, and take Mr. Spider out.
He liked bananas, too, and would go to
the fruit-dish and open one by himself.</p>
<p>Often in the morning at breakfast, he
would perch on the plate or finger-bowl
beside me, and eat his bit of orange.
Usually I had my orange in my room,
and sometimes Dewey would get so impatient
he would fly over to the bed, back
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
to the orange, and beg me to get up.
He always took a drink out of the finger-bowl,
and in the autumn, although he
was put to bed by five o&rsquo;clock, at seven
he would be awakened and taken down
to the dining-room for dessert.</p>
<p>One night he evidently became tired
of waiting, and by himself went into the
dining-room very quietly. We heard a
great splashing, and the first thing we
knew he had plunged into a finger-bowl
and was having a bath to his heart&rsquo;s content,
soaking everything as well as himself.
Of course, it was very cunning,
but, after he had done it for three nights,
we decided two baths a day were too
much for him. Dewey, however, had
made up his mind that if he could not
take a bath in the finger-bowl at night,
he would in the morning, and, as he refused
to go near his old bath-tub, I had
to give in to him, and the bowl was given
him for his own.</p>
<div class="img" id="pica4">
<img src="images/i069.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="684" />
<p class="caption">DEWEY READY FOR HIS BATH</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>It is surprising how few children have
seen a bird take a bath, so I often had
little visitors come in to see Dewey at
his ablutions. One afternoon he wanted
a second bath so badly that he went into
the dining-room, got into a finger-bowl
without any water, and positively would
not get out until water had been put in
and he had his bath. Just to try him
once, I put the bowl on the floor in front
of Taffy, but it did not bother Dewey
in the least; in he went just the same.
There was a bowl of Wandering Jew
on the dining-table, and several times he
took a bath in the centre of it. It was
indeed a beautiful picture, but when I
found he was tearing the vine to pieces,
I decided it was not so pretty, and I gave
Dewey many lectures for it; but he
heeded them not, and, if taken away,
would walk (for he could walk as well
as hop) all over the table on the ends
of his toes, and look everywhere but
toward the bowl. Then, when no one
was looking, he would grab a piece of
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
the Wandering Jew and fly with it to
the top of a picture. One day he
trimmed all the pictures, and there was
none left in the bowl, so after that he
had to look for new mischief.</p>
<p>The next day he could not be found
for a long while, and where do you suppose
I at last found him? Sitting in the
midst of some huge white chrysanthemums.
If he had been sitting there
quietly, no harm would have been done,
but the imp had been busy every minute,
looking for delicious black bugs, and to
get them he was obliged to tear out all
the petals.</p>
<p>Once he tasted some wine, and liked it
so well that whenever any one came in
and had some cake and wine, he would
fly down on their plate, take a bite of
cake, hop up on the wine-glass and take
a sip of wine. In the autumn we had
some very fine cider, and whenever any
one came in, we would offer them some.
One day Dewey saw some on the luncheon-table,
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
and, hopping on the edge of
the glass, took a taste. One taste did
not seem enough for him, however, and
he liked it so well that after that I gave
him some each day in a whiskey glass.
He was a regular little gourmand, and
liked all kinds of fresh fruit and preserves,
but wine jelly and whipped cream
was the best of all.</p>
<p>Sometimes I used to take him down
to dinner with me, when I would give
him his own little table-cloth, and have
a plate for him by my side. He would
usually take a little of everything, and
chicken and cranberry jelly seemed especially
to tickle his palate. Sometimes he
did not behave very well, and he would
go tiptoeing across the table to my mother&rsquo;s
plate, hop on the edge, and see if she
had anything he liked. When dinner was
ready to be served, he would often fly
over to the sideboard, make holes in all
the butter balls, then he would take some
mashed potato and boiled onions and put
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
them to cool in a big hole he had made
in an apple.</p>
<p>Few people know that birds are ever
sick to their stomachs. Dewey had been
in the habit of eating a little shaved
hickory-nut, that was put in a half-shell
and kept in a dish on the back parlour
table. When he came down-stairs, he
would usually take a taste, and it seemed
to agree with him. For a change one
day, I gave him some chestnut, and when
I came in the room a little later, I found
him huddled up in a corner, trying to
go to sleep. As soon as I saw him, I
knew he was not well, for he never
acted that way in the daytime. I put
him back in his cage, and sat down beside
him. He would close his eyes and
open his bill, and I thought he was dying
until all of a sudden he opened his bill
very wide, and out came the chestnut in
a lump half an inch long and one-quarter
wide.</p>
<p>My writing-desk was a favourite place
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
of his. He would get into the drawers,
pigeonholes, and ink, and pictures and
all sorts of small things he would throw
on the floor. Once he stole several dimes
and pennies, and he could lift a silver
dollar, and often would carry a coffee-spoon
all about the room, so you see he
had a very strong bill.</p>
<p>If anything was lost, I always blamed
it on Dewey. One day I looked high and
low for my thimble. I asked Dewey
where it was; he pretended not to hear
me, but, as I was going into my dressing-room,
he dropped it down on my
head from the top of the porti&egrave;re. He
would often perch on a basket on top
of the bookcase in the writing-room.
One day I left a new white veil there,
and when I went to look for it, I found
Dewey had improved it greatly in his
own estimation. There were about ten
little holes right in the front of it, some
round and some star shaped.</p>
<p>As he grew older, he would not sleep
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
in his cage. For a few nights he insisted
on sleeping on the brass rod at the head
of the bed, then changed to the top of
the curtain, where I put a piece of soft
flannel over some cotton on the ledge
and on the wall, so he would not take
cold. If it was very cold, he would go
behind the frill of the curtain out of
every one&rsquo;s sight, but, if it was warm,
he would turn around so his tail would
hang over the outside. When I would
come in in the evening, he would open
his eyes and nod to me, and, if not too
sleepy, would come down and sit on my
hand. He would never chirp or peep,
and when he hid and heard me call,
&ldquo;Dewey, Dewey,&rdquo; he would not answer,
but would fly down on my head, shoulder,
or hand.</p>
<p>Taffy often would get very angry with
him, and sometimes I know he felt like
killing him. Dewey would wake up
early in the morning, and take his exercise
by flying back and forth from a
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
picture on one side of the room to the
head of the bed. When Taffy was on
the foot of it, he would fly very low,
almost touching him with his wings, as
much as to say: &ldquo;You lazy cat, why
don&rsquo;t you wake up and hear the little
birds sing to God Almighty? Why don&rsquo;t
you wake up?&rdquo; Taffy would reply in
words of his own that are not used in
polite society, and the next thing I would
see his tail disappearing around the corner
of the door.</p>
<p>Before Dewey went to sleep at night,
he would exercise again. One afternoon
Taffy was trying to take a nap in a
chair in the back parlour. Dewey kept
flying over him, making a whizzing
sound with his wings. When Taffy
could endure it no longer, he went into
the writing-room and sat down by me.
Dewey came in and perched on the table
to have a little luncheon. Taffy stood
up on his hind legs, reached out a velvet
paw, and gave Dewey such a slap
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
he fell on to the floor. The bird was
not hurt in the least, but flew up on the
picture, and seemed to laugh at the punishment
and scolding Mr. Taffy got.
Taffy did not take his punishment with
the best of grace, and there were many
naughty words he said, while he scratched
and bit, but at last he was conquered,
and after that always behaved like a little
gentleman toward Dewey.</p>
<p>The first time he saw the snow, Dewey
seemed wild with delight, and flew to
the window, trying to catch the pretty
white flakes, but when he heard sleigh-bells,
they seemed to strike terror to his
heart, as I suppose he thought a whole
army of cats was coming, as all he knew
about bells were those on Taffy&rsquo;s collar.</p>
<p>At one time I was ill, and had to send
for a physician whom Dewey had never
seen. When the doctor came up-stairs,
Dewey hid behind the curtain, watching
him intently as he fixed the white powder
in a paper. When the doctor laid it on
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
the table, down swooped Dewey, grabbed
it, and flew with it to his cage. My
mother at this time was ill for many
weeks, and it kept Dewey busy, as he
would carry off all her sleeping powders.
One day he put them behind her bed,
evidently thinking that there they would
not taste so badly and do her just as
much good. He would always watch
the doctor intently, as he mixed the medicine,
and Dewey seemed to think it great
fun peering into the tiny little bottles
in the medicine-case. He would stand
on the ends of his toes and crane his neck
to watch him drop the medicine into the
tumblers.</p>
<p>Dewey&rsquo;s end came at last, however,
in a tragic manner. Some Christmas
roses were brought in to me one day, and
they looked so tempting to Dewey that
he took several bites from them, and the
next day took some more. He acted
queer after that, and kept opening his
bill. I thought he had something in his
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
throat, and gave him some water, which
seemed to help him for the time being.
The next afternoon I found him panting
on the floor. I took him to an open window,
gave him some wine, and the attack
seemed to pass, and apparently he was
as well as ever when I went down to
dinner that night. When I returned to
my room late in the evening, there was
no bird to greet me from the curtain.
I looked on the floor, and there lay my
darling Dewey stiff and cold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">TRINATA</span></h2>
<p>One Sunday in June a small bird a
good deal like a sparrow flew into Trinity
Church. He flew down the centre
aisle, and, evidently drawn to it by the
light, perched on the brass cross underneath
the exquisite chancel window.
When the choir began to sing, he joined
in at the top of his voice, then flew over
to the bishop&rsquo;s chair, peeping and chattering
away, making himself as conspicuous
as possible. Of course, like anything
new in church, he took all the attention
of the congregation from the minister.
From the bishop&rsquo;s chair, he quickly flew
on a girl&rsquo;s shoulder, who caught him in
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
her hand, and put him on the stone steps
outside the door. Here the little traveller
was picked up by another little girl,
taken to Sunday school with her, and
finally was brought to me.</p>
<p>The poor bird was almost famished,
and I hurried him up to my hospital,
which at that time had but one patient,
Theodore Roosevelt, a wild pigeon who
had been badly burned by an electric
wire. I gave him crackers and milk
(it is better for little birds than bread
and milk, and easier to swallow), and,
when he had had his fill, he tried to tuck
his head under his wing and go to sleep.
This he had to give up, as he had a large
head, but few feathers, and small wings,
but he nestled up in my hand and was
soon fast asleep.</p>
<p>He was not a handsome little fellow,
in fact, he was very homely. Some
thought him an English sparrow, but
I doubt whether he was, as they are all
so timid, and he was far from that, always
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
wilful, and did just about as he
pleased.</p>
<p>All day he stayed on my finger or
dress, and when it began to grow dark,
he discovered the neglig&eacute;e I had on was
open at the throat, and a fine place to
crawl into. I rocked him to sleep that
night, and always after that he would
not stay in his basket at night one minute
unless I first rocked him to sleep on my
bare neck.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think Trinata a pretty
name? I gave that to him as he went
to service at Trinity Church. Every one
said he did not know his name, but I
thought he did. After he had been in
the hospital for a couple of weeks, he
ran, or rather, flew, away. I had been
trying to sew, and could not keep him
off me. He would crawl into the palm
of my right hand, and did not seem to
care how hard I squeezed him, then into
the left, and did not mind a prick or two
from the needle. I saw the sewing did
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
not make much headway, so finally I
gave up and started to take my work
down-stairs. I closed the door, or else
he would have flown right after me, but
I forgot the blinds were wide open in
my dressing-room. He evidently went
in there, and the temptation to fly out
was too much for him.</p>
<p>On my return to my room, I looked
everywhere, and had given up all hopes
of ever seeing him again, when I spied
three birds down the street, two large
ones and a small one, which looked suspiciously
like Trinata. When I got near
enough, I began to peep, and the large
ones flew away, but the little one went
hopping along, and when within a few
feet I called out &ldquo;Trinata, Trinata.&rdquo;
He turned in an instant and stopped. I
put out my finger and he hopped on.
It was noontime, and the street was full
of people, who looked with wondering
eyes to see a wee bird in the middle of
the street hop on my fingers. It proved
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
he knew his name, at any rate, and I was
so glad to get him back that, instead of
scolding, I was only too glad to give
him something to eat and rock him to
sleep. He was a forlorn-looking mite,
all mud and grass stain, and so tired and
faint that he could hardly perch. I
think he, too, was glad to get back, for
he never ran away again.</p>
<p>One evening a little boy and girl came
rushing to me with two filthy baby sparrows.
Their legs and claws were so encrusted
with &ldquo;smelly&rdquo; mud they could
not hop. So the first thing was to get
as much off as possible before they could
be put to bed, and in the morning I gave
them a bath in violet water, after which
Jack and Jill, for so I named them,
looked far better, and Jack turned out
to be a perfect beauty.</p>
<p>Trinata became rather jealous of them,
and one day, when Jack and Jill were
close together on my chest, he hopped
down upon my shoulder, wedged himself
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
in between them, and pecked at them
until they flew way. Teddy Roosevelt,
the pigeon, as was right, lived in the
executive mansion, but Trinata did not
stand at all in awe of him. He went
in to see him quite often, and made his
presence known by nipping his toes or
pulling his tail feathers. Teddy, however,
did not like it, and often he would
drive Trinata out.</p>
<p>Jill was very much in love with Jack,
and usually would do anything he told
her, but one day she thought she would
coquette a little and not mind. Jack
tried his best to get her to come inside
the cage, but she paid not the slightest
attention to him. At last he went to the
open door, took her by the wing, and
pulled her inside just as a mother would
take a child. We all thought it very
cunning; but the next day, when Trinata
seized Jill by the leg, and dragged
her way across the floor, I thought it a
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
bit too much, and gave Trinata the good
scolding he deserved.</p>
<p>Jack and Jill, however, were really
most annoying to Trinata, chasing after
him, screeching, and opening their bills
very wide, just as if he was their mother
and would drop some goodies in. One
day he was perched on the window-sill
of the executive mansion, when up came
Jack and Jill with gaping mouths. In
turning to go away, Trinata saw on
Teddy&rsquo;s floor a piece of court-plaster
that had come off from his wing. Trinata
picked it up and dropped it in
Jack&rsquo;s mouth. He spit it out, and then
the tender morsel was thrust down Jill&rsquo;s
throat by Trinata. After that they never
begged him to feed them.</p>
<p>Most birds get used to certain dresses
that a person wears, and usually are
frightened when they see them in anything
else, but Trinata was never afraid.
Once I put on a large hat covered with
pink roses, thinking surely that would
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
frighten him, but he only tucked his head
under his wing and went to sleep on my
shoulder. Another time I put a rustly
silk skirt over my head when he was on
top, but not an inch did he budge. When
dressing, he would often get inside my
waist, and I would fasten it up, leaving
just enough room for him to stick out
his head. He did not mind soap and
water in the least, and very often would
perch on me while I was taking my
morning bath, keeping up an incessant
chatter through it all. He delighted in
visitors, and would light on their hands
without the least sign of fear, and one
day he tried to perch on a gentleman&rsquo;s
bald head, but found it too slippery.
Children all loved him, for he was not
at all exclusive, and would let them
handle him all they wished.</p>
<p>The rougher I played with him the
better he liked it, and I would throw
him here, there, and everywhere, but he
would be back on me quicker than a
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
flash. I do not believe many birds help
make the bed in the morning, but Trinata
used to try to, and seemed to think
it great fun. He would fairly run from
bottom to top and back again, never
minding if sheets and blankets were
thrown over him. When the day spread
was put on, he was told to keep off, but
he seldom obeyed, and would play a long
time trying to pick up the embroidered
pink flowers.</p>
<p>At that time two or three birds were
brought into the hospital nearly every
day. Some died from wounds, and some
from starvation when I was unable to
make them eat. One day I had a forlorn
baby sparrow, a dainty yellowbird (not
much larger than a bumblebee), and two
baby Baltimore orioles. When night
came, I felt like the old woman who
lived in her shoe, for I had so many
birds I didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>I could not supply them all with separate
baskets, so I took a large round one,
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
all gilded, and filled it with cotton, then
made little indentations so it looked like
many little cots. First the strangers
were put in, next Jack and Jill, and they
all lay quietly, but, when it came to
Trinata, there was a row. He evidently
had no intention of sleeping with that
motley crowd, and would not stay in one
second. He knew his own basket, and
would never sleep in any other, or have
any bird sleep with him. In the morning
one of the orioles was dead, but another
a year old came to take its place.
He was a beauty, but had been shot by
some cruel, wicked boy. One wing was
broken, so he could never fly again, and
he had a bad sore, so for days I thought
he could not live, but careful attention
brought him out all right. I named him
the Prince of Wales, and the other oriole
the Princess, who turned out to be the
biggest mischief you can imagine.</p>
<p>About that time a dear little chipmunk
(whom I named McKinley) came to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
hospital, and his life was made miserable
by the Princess. She would steal his
food, examine his eyes, ears, nose, and
mouth with her long bill, and, when he
would not be looking, would give his
tail a good pull.</p>
<p>The morning of the Fourth of July
was intensely warm, so I moved all the
birds into the hall, where it was cooler.
Trinata was put by himself, because if
he was shut up in a cage with Jack and
Jill, he would amuse himself by pecking
them and not letting them get on any
of the perches. If they would try, he
would lift them up by the feathers of
their heads, then throw them down on
the bottom of the cage. Jack and Jill,
then, were put in a cage with the Prince
and Princess, and they all looked very
sleepy when I darkened the hall and went
out. Few people who keep birds, and
especially wild ones, know that they like
to be in the dark during the middle of
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
the day, and it simply ruins a canary to
be left in the sun all day long.</p>
<p>You may imagine my surprise when I
returned to the hall an hour later to find
the Prince in the cage alone. One of the
birds had pried open the place where a
food-dish had been, and Jack, Jill, and
the Princess had gone through the shutter.
The Prince probably realized he
could not fly, so stayed at home. I never
found any trace of Jack and Jill, but,
after looking an hour, located the Princess.
I had only had her about a week,
and did not think she knew her name.
As soon as she heard my voice, she answered,
but was afraid to come down,
as there were so many boys with firecrackers
in the street. Finally she was
frightened to the top of a very tall tree,
where some robins chased her, and she
flew blocks away. A hard thunderstorm
came, and the rain fell in such
torrents that I was sure I had seen the
last of my pretty Princess. After having
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
her liberty for hours, I thought I
heard her voice in the next street. I
went to the open window and called,
&ldquo;Princess.&rdquo; She answered, and every
time I called, the answer came nearer.
Soon I saw her fly across the street and
light on the roof of a house. I hurried
over and held my hand as high as I could,
when down she flew and lighted on my
finger. I think it marvellous, her coming
back, especially as she had been gone
over four hours.</p>
<p>Taffy grew more and more jealous of
Trinata every day, probably not liking
it that I kept him with me so much of
the time. He insisted upon staying in
the hospital all day, and often there
would be nine or ten birds loose in the
room. Frequently he would be there
hours before I knew it, and then I would
not know if I did not happen to hear
the bells on his collar. Then I would lift
up the valance of the bed and find him
stretched out full length, looking as
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
happy and lamblike as though there was
not a bird anywhere near. One day a
lady saw him trying to catch a bird in
the street, and she called out: &ldquo;You
silly cat, why don&rsquo;t you go up-stairs
where there is a room full of them?&rdquo;
He would never pay the slightest attention
to the birds until I would come in
the room, and Trinata would light on
me. Then he would come up to me,
wave his tail, and seem consumed with
jealousy.</p>
<p>One evening when he saw Trinata on
me, it seemed as if he could not contain
himself any longer. He was like a wild
tiger fresh from the jungle. I could
not pacify him, so sent him down-stairs.
At dusk I stood in my dressing-room
door and saw Taffy sneak under my bed.
I was called down suddenly and forgot
him. When I went back a few moments
later, I missed Trinata at once. When
I could not find him, I remembered
Taffy, and rushed down to look for him.
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
He came up from the cellarway looking
pleasant and happy. I took him directly
up to my room and asked him about
his little brother, Trinata. He rubbed
against me, purred, and the fierce tiger
had all left him. I took him down and
said: &ldquo;Taffy has not taken Trinata,
for he never looks or acts like this when
he is guilty.&rdquo; In a few moments I was
called out on the back stoop, and there
sat Taffy with Trinata&rsquo;s mangled remains
before him. When he saw me,
he began to cringe and crouch, and there
was not the slightest doubt of his guilt.
I never knew him to eat a bird before,
and I feel sure, when he heard me calling
him, he swallowed Trinata almost whole,
thinking I would never find out where
he went, and of course it made him
deathly sick. Late that evening he came
into my mother&rsquo;s room. First he stood
in the door. I did not notice him. He
kept coming nearer and nearer, and
finally jumped into my lap, putting both
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
paws about my neck, and began loving
me. For days he was in disgrace, and
for two months he never entered my
room.</p>
<p>He hated Trinata out of pure jealousy
of me, so killed him. He has never
noticed the other birds since, and sleeps
quietly for hours, with any number flying
about him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">CADY</span></h2>
<p>One day when my hospital was so full
of birds I did not know which way to
turn, a little girl came in with a nice
fat baby robin. I said: &ldquo;I cannot take
another patient, for my hospital is full
to overflowing.&rdquo; She begged so hard,
and said: &ldquo;I have taken it away from
a cat three times. The father and
mother bird have gone and left it, and
I cannot make it eat.&rdquo; I could not resist
such pleading, and said: &ldquo;I will
feed it for a few days, then let it go.&rdquo;
But my few days lasted for a year and
a half.</p>
<p>Just at that time I was having a very
pleasant correspondence with Mrs. Stanton,
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
so I said: &ldquo;I am going to name
the bird Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and
call it Cady for short, so, if it turns out
to be a boy, as she always wanted to be,
the name will be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had no trouble in making Cady eat,
and of all the birds I ever had, he was
the most interesting. He seemed to
understand anything I said to him, and
would talk to me by the hour. We had
no difficulty in understanding each other&rsquo;s
language, but I expected every day
to hear him say real words.</p>
<p>For many weeks he lived on crackers
and milk, then Mocking Bird Food, with
only two meal worms a week, for they
are very rich. He loved them dearly, and
it was very hard sometimes not to give
in to him when he asked for more. He
knew where they were kept, and often
turned over the bottle and tried his best
to get them out. He always played with
a worm a long time before eating it.
Then all at once he would give his head
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
a good toss, and down the worm would
go.</p>
<p>One day he treated a large rubber band
in the same way he did his worm,
and, before I realized there might be
danger, it had disappeared. I was dreadfully
frightened, and watched him carefully
all day, but he seemed none the
worse for a change in his diet.</p>
<p>I had him for a year and a half, and
his food always consisted of the Mocking
Bird Food, meal worm, and cracker
and milk for his supper at five o&rsquo;clock.
He was so fond of the latter, I could
not take it away from him entirely, and
when five o&rsquo;clock came, he always knew
and made me understand it was time for
his supper, and would not touch his other
food, no matter how much he had in his
dish. He grew to be very large and
strong and the handsomest robin I have
ever seen. He was very playful, and
had many playthings and played with
them like a dog. Corks were his special
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
delight, and he had many sizes. A piece
of embroidery he could put his bill
through would amuse him many hours.
He knew his name in a very short time,
and, when a baby, if he heard my voice,
or even saw me out in the yard, he would
call just as birds do for their mother.
He was full of mischief and very foxy.
He never was caged, and lived on the
floor and his perches.</p>
<p>I would often see him on the top
perch, looking very intently over into
one corner; then I knew he was like the
little girl, &ldquo;when I be&rsquo;s still, I be&rsquo;s thinking
mischief.&rdquo; In an instant he would
turn and make a dive for one of the
canaries. I had three canaries at that
time, and one day I went into my room
to find feathers all over the floor and
many spots of blood, and Cady on the
highest perch looking as innocent as a
baby. After looking about, I found the
dear little things in a most dilapidated
condition. I was afraid Judy would die,
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
for her wing was put out of joint, but
she finally recovered.</p>
<p>Every morning when I took my bath,
Cady would come into my dressing-room
and have a visit, perched on the wash-stand
or towel-rack, and tell me many
stories. He was a great lover of water,
but he would not take his bath alone,
and I always had to play with him. He
would wait for me until noon, or, in fact,
all day. I gave him a large square willow-ware
vegetable dish for his tub,
which my friends thought much too good
for him, but nothing was too good for
Cady. He always insisted upon having
fresh water for his bath, and never would
take it in water that had stood in the
pitcher overnight. Many times I tried to
fool him, but he was too smart for me.
When he was ready for his bath, he
would go into my dressing-room and
chirp, then come back to me, go back
again, and keep it up until I got the
water. Then the fun commenced. I
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
began by taking water in my hand and
throwing it at him. He would hop all
over the room, come back to me for more,
dance around first on one foot, then on
the other, turn his back to me, then face
me. After we had played enough in
that way, he would hop into the water,
and I would take a whole handful of
water and throw over him, then he would
begin work in good earnest, and such
splashing you never saw.</p>
<p>He certainly was a sight when he had
finished and hopped about the room with
streams of water running off him. It
took him a long time to make his toilet,
for every feather had to be preened just
so.</p>
<p>At that time I had a dear little boy
sparrow named &ldquo;Mack,&rdquo; who was a
beauty and very bright. When Cady
took his bath, he always came down and
took a shower bath. In the fall I began
Cady&rsquo;s music lessons, and every one
laughed at the idea of my thinking I
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
could teach him to sing with me. Every
day after luncheon I spent an hour with
him. I would put him on the back of
a chair by the piano and play and sing
a very catchy little waltz song, and I
kept it up for weeks before he would
sing at all, but I knew by his looks and
actions he was taking it all in, so I was
determined I would not give up. Finally
one day he began to follow me with the
sweet notes of a canary, and I hardly
dared breathe, but went right on singing
as if I did not hear him, and from that
day on he improved with every lesson.
Next I took the waltz song &ldquo;First
Love&rdquo; from &ldquo;Olivette,&rdquo; and he showed
great delight with the change, and entered
right into the spirit of the song.
We sung that for many weeks, always
beginning our lessons with the first waltz
song. Then for a change I thought I
would try him with a waltz song, &ldquo;May
Blossoms,&rdquo; which was entirely different
in style and tone. He liked that best
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
of all, and it was simply marvellous the
way he sang it. He was always in such
a hurry to sing it, he would often begin
before the music. I began with the idea
of giving him a prize when we had finished
our lessons, but that did not suit
him at all, and he gave me to understand
that he must have one to begin on. He
soon learned to take his position on the
chair when I brought him into the parlour.
I would begin to play, and sometimes,
before he thought, he would sing
a few notes, then he would remember his
treat, and down he would hop into a
chair, then over to another chair which
stood in the back parlour, as he was
afraid of a fur rug that lay between the
doors, and would never put his claws in
it. He would perch on the arm of the
chair until I went to my tea-table and
got a crumb of biscuit or cake and gave
to him, then he would hop back the way
he came, take his position, and begin to
sing. After his lesson he always had a
taste of honey and a drink of water out
of a whiskey glass. He seemed very
proud of his accomplishments, and was
always more than willing to show off
for visitors,&mdash;take a bath as well as sing
for them.</p>
<div class="img" id="pica5">

<p class="caption">CADY TAKING HIS SINGING LESSON</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>One day he was in the back parlour
and wanted to go into the front parlour.
A gentleman was sitting with his legs
crossed in the chair that was his stepping-stone,
and what to do he did not know.
Several times he hopped on to the first
arm, then on to the floor, would look at
the fur rug, but could not get up enough
courage to go over it. Again, as he
hopped on to the arm, his eye caught
the toe of the gentleman&rsquo;s shoe. In an
instant he was on it and over into the
front parlour, singing with great glee
over his cunning feat.</p>
<p>One day in the spring, when I was
giving him his lesson, a friend came in
with a very large dog. Cady had never
seen a dog before, and I was afraid he
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
would die of fright and that his voice
was ruined for ever. I could not get
him to sing a note for many weeks. He
showed the same fear every time I
brought him down to the parlours. After
he had finished moulting in the fall,
he was more beautiful than ever. Every
feather was perfect and shone like satin.
I brought him down-stairs to show to a
friend, and the first thing he did was
to take his position on the chair by the
piano and begin to chirp, and I knew
he was asking me to play for him. For
six months he had not sung a note, so
you may imagine my delight when out
poured the sweetest trills of the best bred
canary. Like all robins, Cady was a very
early riser, and during the summer he
would wake me at five o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, and I would have no peace
until I opened my blinds. Of course,
it was very nice for Cady, but, oh, poor
me! Never before or since have I ever
gotten up so early, for sleep was out of
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
the question. He would come down on
my bed, perch on my shoulder, and send
the sweetest trills right down into my
ear, but I could not fully appreciate them
at that early hour. If that did not take
effect, he would peck my hands; if I
put them under the cover, then my eyes,
cheeks, nose, and mouth.</p>
<p>I regret very much that Cady&rsquo;s photograph
was not taken when he was taking
a sun bath. He would toss back his
head, spread out his wings, lean against
anything that was most convenient, and
a lady with a train posing for her portrait
could not have been more graceful.
Every one said: &ldquo;When winter comes,
Cady will feel the cold,&rdquo; but Cady had
no intention of being cold, and a warm
room was all the Florida he cared for.</p>
<p>Instead of a sun bath, he took a fire
bath, and often before he went to sleep
for the night he would perch on the back
of a low chair by the fire, and drink in
all the warm air he could hold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>The first autumn I had Cady, I was
told I must clip his wings, for he was
never caged. A friend came one day,
and we clipped several of the birds&rsquo;
wings, but my heart was broken when it
was done, for they all felt so ashamed,
especially Cady. At that time I had the
Princess of Wales, and she was a most
inquisitive little lady. She would follow
Cady about, look him all over, get him
into a corner, examine his wings, and
lift up with her bill the one that had been
clipped. The next autumn, when Cady&rsquo;s
new feathers came in, they were so beautiful
I did not have the heart to clip
his wings again. But he was getting so
unruly, chasing my other small birds, flying
through the air and picking them
up as if they were flies, that I did not
know what to do with him. I knew I
must clip his wing or cage him, and I
knew the latter would simply kill the
poor bird. Each day I would get ready
to cut it my courage would fail, and I
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
would put it off until the next, and, like
all things we keep putting off, there
came a day when I would have given
all I possessed if I had clipped his wing
in the beginning.</p>
<p>Cady was afraid out-of-doors. One
day he fell out of my bedroom window,
and waited for me to come and get him.
He often stood in my bedroom window,
but never seemed to care to go out. If
I took him into the yard, he would fly
back into the house if the door was
open.</p>
<p>One day I took him quite a walk to
see a friend. He perched on my wrist
(as my finger was too small), did not
offer to get off, and seemed very much
at home in the friend&rsquo;s house, so I never
thought of his going away. When he
began his lessons in the autumn, his wing
was all feathered out, and he could fly
everywhere. Instead of hopping from
chair to chair for his treat, he would fly
out into the dining-room, light on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
dining-room table and wait for me to
come.</p>
<p>One Sunday morning I had been giving
him a longer lesson than usual, for
he was singing better than I had ever
heard him. All at once he stopped short,
flew as usual into the dining-room, where
the door was opened on to the piazza, and
out of it he went, soaring way up in the
air. It was a glorious day, and when he
lighted in a tall tree up the street, I could
hear him singing with delight. If I could
have had the street to myself, I am sure
I could have gotten him, but it was
just the hour when the children were returning
from Sunday school, and I could
not keep them away. Twice he came
within a few feet of me, then the boys
or the rustle of the leaves frightened him
away. For weeks he was about, and I
spent many hours trying to get him to
come to me. He always answered my
call, but seemed afraid to fly down to
me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>I would not have taken hundreds of
dollars for him, and whatever became of
him I know not, but I fear he perished
when winter came, as he knew nothing
about migrating.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">SOME TRANSIENT PATIENTS</span></h2>
<p>A young meadow-lark was brought
to me one morning by a small boy, whose
dog had chased it and broken its leg.
I had never had any experience in setting
bones, but, as there is always a first
time, I thought I could at least try, even
if I did not succeed. I found it was not
a very easy thing to do alone, but, after
trying a number of times, I managed
to get my toothpick splint on securely.
For several days the leg seemed to be
doing nicely, and I felt quite proud of
my work and sure the leg was knitting.
All at once the bird began to smell very
badly, and in a few days it died, so I
think it must have been hurt internally.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Another morning I had an orchard
oriole brought to me. He, like the
Prince of Wales, had been shot. One
wing was broken and there was a deep
flesh wound underneath. I did not expect
to save him, but, after a few days,
the wound healed and he was perfectly
well, except the broken wing, which did
not bother him. He seemed very happy,
even if he could only fly a very little,
and spent most of his time hopping about
on the floor. His favourite perching-place
was on the top of a candle on my
dressing-table.</p>
<p>One morning he came over to my bed
and woke me by pecking my hands. As
it was too early for me to wake, I put
him on the floor and went to sleep.
When I got up, I could not find my
pretty Duke. He had never been in my
dressing-room, but that morning the light
must have attracted him, as my room
was dark, and in trying to hop on the
edge of the water-jar he fell in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>You can imagine my horror when I
saw him in the water dead, with his
lovely feathers all spoiled, and I felt I
had been a careless nurse.</p>
<p>A cousin brought to the hospital from
the country a young snipe. She was so
afraid it would get away, she put it into
a shoe box which was too small, then
tied the cover down tight, without making
one hole to let the air in. Consequently,
when she arrived, the bird was
just gasping and almost dead.</p>
<p>I had never seen a young snipe before,
and I was so anxious to save it. It was
a beauty. Of course, it was all legs and
feet, but they were really beautiful in
shape, and the colour like the soft shade
of green in young twigs. I worked over
it four hours, hoping I might bring it
back to life, but it was beyond me. It
was a most pitiful sight to see it take so
long to die.</p>
<p>I was very glad one day to have the
pleasure of looking over a chimney swift,
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
but, as it was an old bird and not hurt in
the least, I felt it would be cruel to keep
it in the hospital. It was so frightened
it did not fly off from my hand for five
minutes after I took it out-of-doors.</p>
<p>One day a very tender-hearted little
boy, with big tears in his eyes, came and
asked me to take in a tiny baby bird not
three inches long from end of bill to tip
of tail. It was gray with white breast,
long pointed white bill, and very large
eyes. Its pretty little head was drawn
back like a person having spinal meningitis,
and it was making a mournful
peep. When I took it into my hand,
I did not think it could live but a few
moments, but it did four hours, suffering
all the time, and it seemed as if its pitiful
peep would drive me wild. I managed
to get a little milk down its throat,
but I could not find the cause of the
head being drawn back, as there was no
sign of any bruise. Finally I saw a
black speck sticking out of its bill. I
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
began to pull, and kept on until I had
pulled out a quarter of a yard of coarse
horsehair. I knew then there was something
on the other end, and that the bird
could not live with whatever it was in
its throat. I gave a quick pull, and you
can imagine my surprise when out came
a piece of hard white shell, triangular
shape, all wound around with the hair.
No wonder the little thing peeped, and
that its head was drawn back, with that
sharp point sticking into its throat. The
mother must have rammed it down her
baby&rsquo;s throat, thinking it was some
goody.</p>
<p>After I had removed the shell, the
little sufferer seemed so relieved; the
peeping stopped, and it would try to flop
its wee wings when it saw me with the
milk. I was in hopes I was going to
save it, but it did not have the strength
to rally, and it went where all good
birdies go.</p>
<p>For a week I had a dear baby robin,
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
who came down-stairs every night to look
me up when it was time for him to go
to bed in his basket. I had a wild pigeon
at the time who delighted in pecking any
small bird who came to the hospital. He
gave the robin a hard peck on the back
of the neck, I suppose striking a nerve,
for soon the head began to draw back,
and in a few hours he died. Theodore
Roosevelt, the wild pigeon, was in the hospital
two long years, receiving constant
treatment, from burns which he had
received by being caught in electric wires.</p>
<p>Then I had a large white domestic
pigeon that was taken away from a dog
who was tearing him to pieces. Such
a sight as he was, covered with blood
and mud, when I took him in. The
feathers were all torn out of one wing,
and he could not stand on his feet. The
first thing I gave him a bath in warm
water and soap, then found several flesh
wounds, which I powdered with talcum
powder (never put anything greasy on
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
a bird), and put him in a cot, where I
kept him as quiet as possible for several
days. He was not at all timid, ate from
my hand, drank water from a whiskey
glass, as if he had always been fed in
that way, never even trying to stand up
or get out of his cot. I felt quite encouraged
when, after a week, he could
perch on my wrist for a few minutes,
so I knew that there were no bones
broken, but I was afraid that he was
never going to have the use of one of his
claws, for the toes all turned under when
he tried to put it down, but patience and
care were my reward, for it got entirely
well. You could fairly see the new feathers
grow in his wing, and he was delighted
when he could flop his wings and
exercise. It was very interesting to
watch him when he first began trying to
walk. I would put him down on the
floor. He would lift the lame foot very
high, and throw the claws out before
putting it down, to prevent the toes turning
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
under. I expected he would want
to fly away when he found he was made
whole again, but he did not seem to have
the slightest desire. He became quite a
pet, and when I spoke to him, he would
bow his head and say, &ldquo;Coo-wee, coo-wee,
coo-wee,&rdquo; but he was too large a
bird for the house, and he now lives with
many of his kind, where he has the best
of care.</p>
<p>One morning I saw a baby sparrow
on a piazza, and a cat just ready to
spring at it. I got in ahead of the cat,
and brought her home with me. I wish
all of the people who say they hate the
English sparrow could have known this
one, whom I named &ldquo;Monie.&rdquo; She was
a perfect little beauty, and full of all
sorts of antics. Every feather shone like
satin, and her colouring was the soft
shade of brown you see in otter fur.
She loved to tease the other birds, especially
the canaries. She would go inside
the cage when they were on top and
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
bite their claws and try to pull them
through the bars. Then she would hang
with one claw caught on the top of the
cage and go through all sorts of performances.
I had a box which rested
on a low table, divided off into two compartments,
one filled with gravel and the
other with food. In the centre of one
side was part of a broomstick, with any
number of perches all sizes on it, and a
platform over the other side where a
brass cage stood. The box and perches,
being painted light green, made a pretty
sight when the perches were filled with
many birds of different size and colour.
There was a platform that rested on the
window-sill, where Teddy, the pigeon,
liked best to stay. He would walk back
and forth or sit there most of the day,
looking out of the windows. When, he
wanted to walk in the gravel or get
something to eat, he would walk down
the little steps into the box with a great
deal of dignity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>Monie always insisted upon perching
on one of the largest perches, and very
often she would fall on to the floor, and,
as her wing was clipped, she could not get
back in the box until I picked her up. At
that time there were some mice who came
and ate with the birds. Taffy did not
seem to think they had any right there,
and often tried to catch them. Twice
he picked Monie up off from the floor,
thinking she was a mouse, and brought
her down-stairs. When he saw me, he
came right up to me and let me take her
out of his mouth, as if he was glad to
get rid of her. The next time I missed
her, I looked ten minutes, then I heard
Taffy ring his bells, and he kept it up
until I found him behind a heavy curtain,
lying down with his paws under him,
and holding Monie very carefully in his
mouth. I put out my hand and he laid
her in it, and she was not hurt in the
least. After that I tried my best to make
Monie sleep on a smaller perch, but she
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
was as wilful as she was pretty, and no
other perch seemed to suit her. Her
wilfulness caused her death, for she fell
off in the middle of the night when the
room was dark. Taffy picked her up and
she squealed like a mouse. As he held
her tighter, she squealed louder, and
Taffy thought he had a mouse sure. I
jumped out of bed, but, by the time I
got a light, he had choked her to death.
When he saw that he had Monie instead
of a mouse, he put her into my hand,
and no person could have shown more
grief.</p>
<p>Late one evening a small boy came to
the door and asked if I did not want to
buy a white rat. To get rid of the boy,
I bought the rat, thinking I would give
it to our boy the next morning, but he
was so bright and cunning, I named him
Billy Watt, and kept him many months.
He was a most interesting pet and very
much like a squirrel in all of his ways.
Taffy thought it was &ldquo;adding insult to
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
injury&rdquo; to ask him to be polite to Billy
Watt, but he soon understood he was to
treat him as politely as the birds.</p>
<p>One day Billy Watt bit Monie so the
blood came. I took him in one hand,
Monie in the other, and let her bite his
nose, ears, and paws, and it frightened
him almost to death when he found a
bird could bite as well as a rat, and he
never touched her again.</p>
<p>It was hard to make people believe,
who did not see it, that Taffy would
sleep for hours in my room, with birds
flying around and Billy Watt asleep in
a basket near by.</p>
<p>The largest patient I ever had was a
turkey-buzzard, and the smallest full-grown
bird a Parola warbler.</p>
<p>When Taffy beheld Mr. Buzzard
perched on the back of a chair, his wrath
knew no bounds. He did not spring at
him, simply sat down in front of him,
and by the growling and spitting you
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
would have thought there were a dozen
of cats instead of one.</p>
<p>One day our neighbour&rsquo;s crow came
to visit us, and insisted upon sitting in
Taffy&rsquo;s chair, which did not suit his
Royal Highness at all. He stood upon
his hind legs with his front paws on the
chair, and smelled Mr. Crow all over,
but Mr. Crow did not mind in the least
and would not move, so Mr. Taffy
jumped into the chair and curled himself
up by the side of the crow, and they
spent the day together.</p>
<p>Once I read with the greatest interest
an article about a Parola warbler, and
felt I would like very much to know the
authoress, and tell her there was another
person who had come in as close contact
with one as she did. One can read dozens
of beautiful descriptions of these daintiest
of fairies, but no one can have the
slightest conception of their beauty, or
half appreciate them, until they have
held one in their hand. Mine was caught
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
by a cat, but it lived all day, so I had
plenty of time to study every exquisite
feather.</p>
<p>I hope the day may come when I shall
be fortunate enough to see another, but
they are very rare, especially in Central
New York.</p>
<p>The Parola warbler was the first bird
that opened John Burroughs&rsquo;s eyes to the
beauty of birddom.</p>

<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">JUDY AND NED</span></h2>
<p>Those who have not tried mating and
raising birds have lost a great deal of
pleasure. Besides being intensely interesting,
one learns many things worth
knowing.</p>
<p>Once I heard a lady say that she
thought all women ought to raise birds
before trying to bring up a family, for
there was so much to be learned from the
birds.</p>
<p>I had a friend who was very anxious
for me to try my luck at bird-raising,
so one day she brought over her handsome
green and gold canary. At that
time I had a number of birds, among
them three which I thought were females,
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
but I was only sure of one, a little
girl sparrow. Blondell&mdash;a canary&mdash;was
given to me for a female, but several
said they were sure it was a male. She
was an exquisite yellow of different
shades, with a topknot of yellow tipped
with white, then black, with a catching
little bang.</p>
<p>Judy&mdash;a canary&mdash;was bought for a
singer, but the person who gave her to
me said she had never sung, but she
thought the reason was because she had
the asthma. I think she was a goldfinch,
for she was very small, with black wing
feathers, and a pretty black topknot
parted in the middle. I had named her
after one of my dearest friends, so I
immediately called the green canary Ned
after her better half. Ned knew more
than any of us, for, as soon as he was
let out of his cage, he flew over in front
of Judy and sat down before her, never
noticing the other birds, and poured the
most entrancing song right into her ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>It certainly was love at first sight, and
for a year their devotion was something
rare to see. Then Blondell made trouble
in the family. Ned and Judy&rsquo;s courtship
was of short duration, and soon they
began housekeeping in good earnest. I
gave them a cage, and hung it on the
wall, so they would not be bothered with
the other birds. During the day they
went where they pleased, but, when
night came, they always went back to
their cage and perched as close as they
could to each other.</p>
<p>After the eggs were laid, and Judy
had to sleep on the nest, Ned perched as
close to the nest as he could get.</p>
<p>Judy&rsquo;s nest was most beautifully made,
a perfect symphony of colour, and a delight
to the eye. I gave to her bits of
pink, blue, yellow, green, and white cotton,
little pieces of dainty coloured baby
ribbon and pink string. She wove the
ribbons all in with the cotton, then festooned
the outside with the pink string,
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
and on the top she laid chickweed with
its tiny white blossoms. When she was
making her nest, I noticed she had the
cotton very high above the basket and
none in the bottom, so I thought I would
lend a helping hand and fix the bottom
for her. A more angry bird I never
saw when she discovered I had been meddling
with something I knew nothing
about. She stood on the top of the nest
and scolded for some time, then reached
down and took out all of the cotton I
had put in and threw it on the bottom
of the cage. When she was ready, she
put the cotton in to suit herself.</p>
<p>She laid four eggs, but none hatched
out, so she and Ned took the nest apart,
and a new one was made of all new
material, more beautiful than the first.</p>
<p>She laid four eggs again, but the long
strain of setting was telling upon her,
for Ned was not a good nurse, and did
not like staying at home and feeding her.
If it had not been for me, I am afraid
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
she would have gone hungry many times.
Finally one egg hatched out, and it was
not as large as a bumblebee. Unfortunately,
the chick only lived one day. By
that time it was so warm I took the nest
away, but Ned&rsquo;s devotion seemed to increase
instead of diminish. Every morning
they would kiss each other, and every
night before going to sleep, and they
always slept side by side. This went on
for a year, and they were such a happy
pair. In the spring they went to housekeeping
again, and everything was going
on in the most blissful way when Monie
and Blondell thought they would like a
beau and go to housekeeping, too. So
they began to flirt and coquette in a most
shocking way with Mr. Ned, a married
man. I used to say: &ldquo;You naughty,
wicked girls, you better stop your nonsense,
for Ned will never leave that dear
little wife of his, for he loves her too
dearly to waste any time on either of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>But, alas, a little flattery was all that
was needed to make him false to the
loving wife, who simply adored him and
was his slave.</p>
<p>Judy and Ned had been in the habit
of making love to each other on the top
of the large mirror over my dressing-table.
They would promenade back and
forth and toss their pretty heads, and
you could easily imagine all the charming
little tales of love Ned was confiding
to Judy, and every little while they would
kiss each other.</p>
<p>Sweet little Monie, with her dainty,
quiet dress, did not seem to have any
charm for Ned, so she took up with
Mack, who was English like herself.</p>
<p>One day when Judy was sitting on her
nest, and Ned was getting uneasy and
very tired of staying at home and waiting
upon her, Miss Blondell sallied forth
with every feather preened, until she was
a mass of shimmering gold. She went
up on top of the mirror and promenaded,
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
well knowing admiring eyes were gazing
at her, for how could any one help looking
at such grace and beauty? She soon
began making eyes at Ned, and calling
to him in a sweet, cooing voice to come
to her. He simply could not resist her
and was soon by her side. Judy scolded
and scolded, and called to him many
times to come home, but not the slightest
attention did he pay to her, and really,
I do not suppose he heard one word she
said, for he was so completely fascinated
with that exquisite blonde. Judy stood
it as long as she could, but when Ned
kissed Blondell before her very eyes, that
was more than any one could expect her
to endure. She flew out of her cage,
over on to the mirror, and if she did not
tell the little blonde lady just what she
thought of her, I am much mistaken.
She then turned to Ned, in her old affectionate,
bewitching way, with her pretty
little head cocked on one side, and asked
him to kiss her, but he refused for the
first time. She went back to her nest
broken-hearted, and never interfered with
them again. Soon Ned and Blondell had
the face to go to housekeeping right next
door, Ned going from one house to the
other, but Judy never allowed Blondell
to enter her door.</p>
<div class="img" id="pica6">
<img src="images/i135.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="606" />
<p class="caption">BLONDELL</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>I feel sure that Ned really loved Judy
the best, for he spent more time with
her than he did with Blondell, but there
was something about Blondell that he
could not resist, for she simply hypnotized
him.</p>
<p>I was ill at the time, so I had plenty
of leisure lying in bed to watch them.
My nurse often said she was so interested
in the birds she could hardly take
care of her patient.</p>
<p>Blondell was punished for making so
much trouble for Judy, for none of her
eggs hatched out. Then Ned&rsquo;s mistress
took Blondell to her house and mated her
with her bird, Dick. Blondell was only
too delighted to have a new lover, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
she soon forgot all about faithless Ned.
She raised one lovely green and gold
bird like his father. I brought them both
home, and named her son &ldquo;Mike&rdquo; after
one of the most wonderful boy singers
the world has ever known or ever will.
Mike was always very uneasy, and acted
more like a wild bird, and it was almost
impossible to keep him in his cage. He
was full of all sorts of antics and loved
to torment his mother.</p>
<p>I looked forward to having a fine
singer, but he was not contented in this
small town, so one warm, bright morning
in the fall he went abroad to cultivate his
voice, and we have never seen him since.</p>
<p>I still have Blondell, and some day
I hope she may have another son.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">DONA MARINA</span></h2>
<p>Dona Marina came to the hospital,
not as a patient, but as a destroyer of
patients. Since that time she has been a
great deal of care with her numerous
kittens and a very bad burn on her side
and head. I accidentally turned a tea-kettle
of boiling water over her. I dried
her as quickly as possible, then covered
her with talcum powder, and kept her
shut up in the hospital all day.</p>
<p>She was a great sufferer, and for hours
was in perfect agony. Still, I did not
realize for days how badly she was
burned until the hair began to come out.
For three months she had a scab as large
as my hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>She bore her sufferings very bravely.
When the scab began to loosen, she would
come to me every day and ask me to cut
off the loose edges. She would stand
very quietly while I trimmed them with
my manicure scissors.</p>
<p>Every one said the sore would not heal,
and, if it did, the hair would never come
in, but the scab is all gone, and the hair
has come in and almost covered the bare
spots.</p>
<p>I so often hear people say: &ldquo;I would
like so much to keep a cat, but I cannot
on account of my bird,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I would
enjoy having a bird, but of course I
cannot, because my cat would kill it in
less than a wink.&rdquo; I used to think the
very same way. When a child, I had
a number of canary birds, which went
down my neighbours&rsquo; cats&rsquo; throats if they
did not mind, so I gave up keeping birds,
as I liked cats so much better, and I did
not have one for years, until &ldquo;Little
Billee&rdquo; came to me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>I did such wonderful things with
Taffy. I think all that is needed is a
great deal of patience and to understand
cat language and have cats understand
you.</p>
<p>Two years ago a neighbour&rsquo;s black cat
was determined to kill my canary Blondell,
and I was just as determined she
should not. I fought her for a year and
a half, but it was simply impossible to
keep her out of the house, as our doors
and windows were opened nearly as much
in winter as in summer, and she would
be in the house hours before I knew it.
I was not allowed by her owner to put
bells on her, so as to warn Blondell and
me of her approach, and the first thing
I would hear was a crash and the cage
fall on the floor. Often when lying
down I would hear Blondell screech, and
open my eyes to see the cat on top of
the cage. As the cage always stood on
a low table, it was very easy to reach.</p>
<p>We did everything we could to
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
frighten the cat to keep her away, but
I would not hurt her or let any one else.
One day the woman who was cleaning
for me gave her a dreadful beating with
a wet floor-cloth, and said: &ldquo;Now, I
guess you will go home and stay there.&rdquo;
I came out just as the cat was going
and said: &ldquo;Poor kitty.&rdquo; She turned and
fairly flew to my side, and from that
day to this she has been devoted to me.</p>
<p>When I found she had fully made up
her mind to come here and live, and nothing
would keep her away, I said: &ldquo;I
will teach her not to kill my bird.&rdquo; My
friends all laughed in my face and said:
&ldquo;The idea of your thinking you can
teach an ill-bred cat, who has never had
any bringing up, the same as you taught
an intelligent cat like Taffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I soon found the cat was very affectionate,
and that she loved me, and that
is the best beginning you can have. I
named her Dona Marina, as she was
black enough for a Spanish lady. Her
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
coat was black and shiny and her head
and paws very small. In a few days she
knew her name, so I felt she was quick
to learn. From the day I gave the name
to her, she has never been called anything
else, and always answers me and
will carry on long conversations with me.
If she is up in my room and I go to the
foot of the stairs and say: &ldquo;Dona Marina,&rdquo;
she answers me. If I say, &ldquo;Dona
Marina, are you up-stairs?&rdquo; she answers
twice. I always invited her to come into
my room when she came up-stairs, and,
if she went after Blondell, I closed my
door, then punished her by slapping her
paws and talking to her, but never sent
her out of my room. She soon understood
she could stay there as long as she
behaved herself, and spent many hours
without me there. Still I was not quite
sure of her, and every one said: &ldquo;She
will kill Blondell some day.&rdquo; When I
went out of the house, I sent her down-stairs
and closed the door. That went on
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
for many weeks, when one day I went
to my room about four o&rsquo;clock. Dona
Marina had been asleep on my bed since
luncheon with Blondell and no one else.
It seemed a pity to wake her and make
her go down, so I thought I would take
the risk, and went out and left her.
Several friends said they would not feel
sorry for me at all if, when I went home,
I did not even find a tail feather. I
laughed and said I had no fear, as I
fully trusted Dona Marina, but I trembled
just the same, and, when I reached
home at six o&rsquo;clock, I went to the stairs
and called in a shaky voice: &ldquo;Dona
Marina, are you up-stairs?&rdquo; and when
the answer came, &ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; I fairly
flew up the stairs, and there, to my great
joy, was Blondell happy in her cage and
my little black lady stretched out full
length on my bed, greeting me with loving
eyes and a sweet song. Since that
day I never gave her a thought. She
sits on the table by the cage and looks
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
at Blondell, never putting up a paw,
and lies down and goes to sleep by the
side of her.</p>
<p>Dona Marina very seldom walks on
the floor; she simply flies through the
air. She comes on a run from the
kitchen, lands in the middle of the dining-room
table, then jumps into a chair
by the back parlour door, into a chair
in the back parlour, into another chair,
then on top of the table. If she is on
her way up-stairs, she makes one grand
leap, which lands her in the front parlour
by the door going into the hall. She
never pauses, but on she flies up the
stairs into my room, over the top of the
bird-cage, on to my work-table, and sits
down, as if it were the only way to enter
a room.</p>
<p>She is a very intelligent cat, and I
often wish she did not know so much.
Like all my pets, she is spoiled, and does
everything she wishes to. Last spring
she had her first kittens, and I, of course,
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
was the trained nurse, and such a time
as I had. As four babies were too many
for me to have up-stairs, two were taken
away at once and put in a pail of water.
Then my trouble began. She took on so,
and seemed to think I could bring them
back, and would not give me any peace
until I fished them out of the water,
dried them on a towel, and brought them
into the parlour. She took them at once
up to my dressing-room. She had her
bed in a nice basket, with linen sheets,
in an old-fashioned chest. After a few
minutes, I brought them down and she
came for them. After taking them back
three times, she found she could not
bring them to life, and gave up. When
I had gotten into bed, she came to me,
talked, then went back to her babies.
After keeping at me for a half-hour,
and I did not make any move to get up,
she came and took right hold of my chin.
After she bit me three times, I thought
I had better get up and see what she
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
wanted. She soon made me understand
she wanted the basket taken out and put
on my bed, so no one could get her
babies. I did so, putting a kimono on
the foot and covering the basket. She
got into the basket, and there was no
more trouble. I did that for two nights,
and then she seemed to think there was
no more danger and she stayed in the
chest.</p>
<p>One night she insisted upon my getting
up at three o&rsquo;clock. I thought she must
be hungry, and went into my dressing-room
and saw that there was no milk in
her dish. I also felt there was a great
change in the weather and saw the
ground was covered with snow, so I put
down the windows, then went down-stairs
after the milk. When I came back, I
found Dona Marina in the basket with
her kittens, looking very happy. I offered
her the milk, and she said: &ldquo;No,
thank you. It was too cold for my
darlings, and all I wanted was the window
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
put down.&rdquo; I could have choked
her with a good will.</p>
<p>When it was time for her children to
learn to get out of the basket, she lifted
them out and put them on the floor, and
asked me to take the basket. One was
black as coal, and the other maltese.
The black one we named &ldquo;Ping,&rdquo; and
the gray one &ldquo;Pong,&rdquo; and they were
very different in all their ways.</p>
<p>My trials began when their mother
thought they needed something more
than milk. Every one said: &ldquo;You want
to look out for Blondell, now Dona
Marina has her kittens,&rdquo; but she went
outdoors for all of her game, and the
dear baby birds she used to bring in almost
broke my heart. She would bring
them to me first, but, if they were not
dead, they were wounded so they soon
died.</p>
<p>One day she carried a large fish up
to them just as the man brought it in
the paper. When they were four weeks
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
old, she thought they ought to sleep on
the foot of my bed instead of in their
basket. I was determined I would not
give in to her, but, after keeping me
awake until after two o&rsquo;clock one night,
I said: &ldquo;Go bring your babies, and we
will all go to sleep.&rdquo; After that they
slept on the foot of my bed until they
were given to a very nice little girl when
they were two months old.</p>
<p>Dona Marina mourned for them for
two weeks, and would carry up food in
mouthfuls and look all over for them.</p>
<p>Two months ago Dona Marina presented
me with four more babies, which
was a little more than I had bargained
for. Two were taken from her before
she hardly had time to count, so she did
not make as much fuss as she did the
first time.</p>
<p>A little girl came to see them, and
said: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you name them after
their mother?&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;I do not think
it would be nice to call them both Dona
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
Marina.&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;Oh, no; call one
Dona and the other Marina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dona is twice the size of Marina, is
black and white, and looks like a little
circus pony. Marina is most beautifully
marked. Her head, back, and tail are
black, face black, also her legs, white
whiskers, and a tiny white line between
the eyes. Under her chin white about
as wide as your finger, then broadens
and goes half down the neck, broadens
out again, narrows at the breast bone,
broadens again, and goes all the way
down. She has four white paws, so you
see she has a very swell black and white
costume.</p>
<p>Marina is full of mischief, but very
affectionate. Dona is much more quiet
and dignified, but is also affectionate,
and loves to have me take him on my
shoulder.</p>
<p>They were born in the same basket,
and Dona Marina went through the same
performance about taking them out when
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
it was time to have the basket on the
floor, also the same performance about
sleeping on the foot of my bed, and,
of course, I had to give in to her.</p>
<p>At the present time Marina is on my
lap and Dona on my shoulder. They
have full sway of the house, and what
they cannot do is not worth doing.</p>
<p>One day when I came in, I thought
there must have been an army of children
in the parlours, by the sight that met
my eyes. All the books from the lower
shelf of the bookcase were on the floor.
They had gotten up on the magazine
table and thrown all the magazines on
the floor. Sofa pillows were everywhere
but where they ought to be. A large
corn-cob in the front parlour, and corn-husks
here, there, and everywhere, with
scraps of paper in every direction, and
Dona and Marina fast asleep in the
empty scrap-basket, while their mother
lay curled up in an easy-chair.</p>
<p>During the day they go outdoors and
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
all over the house, but when the house is
lighted, they seem to think up-stairs is
the place for them.</p>
<p>We have had great fun catching flies.
They come and ask me to help them. I
take my handkerchief, and, when I get
a fly in it, they come and take it out, and
sometimes there is quite a fight to see
which gets it.</p>
<p>I was in hopes to have had many interesting
things to tell about Dona and
Marina, but a friend came for them
to-day, and I could not say &ldquo;No&rdquo; again,
as I had promised them when they were
wee babies, but I shall miss them greatly,
and I feel very sad and lonely to-night
without my baby pets.</p>

<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">BOBBINETTE AND BOBBY&mdash;TWO ORPHANS</span></h2>
<p>Those who have been fortunate
enough to have read that charming little
story of &ldquo;Bobby and Bobbinette,&rdquo; by
Mrs. Talbot, will know where I found
these names. Instead of being two New
York children, they are two Seneca Falls
robins, but the names fit as if made to
order, as they are just as different as
the original Bobby and Bobbinette. Bobbinette
rules Bob with a rod of iron, and
he meekly does as he is bid.</p>
<p>One bright morning in May, as I
came into the yard, I saw Dona Marina
sitting on the front piazza charming
a nice, plump baby robin, who was
perched on a water-pipe not three feet
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
away. She was opening and shutting
her mouth, making that hissing sound,
and her large green eyes were fairly
glued to the robin&rsquo;s black ones. Just as
she was ready to spring, I called out
sharply: &ldquo;Dona Marina, you wicked
cat, don&rsquo;t you dare catch that baby bird.&rdquo;
She turned around in the most leisurely
way, and came to meet me with the air
of the innocent.</p>
<p>If I had not seen her with my own
eyes, I never should have suspected she
had the least designs on the bird. The
mother bird was calling and screeching
with rage in a tree near by. As soon
as Dona Marina&rsquo;s back was turned, the
frightened bird hopped down, and went
around in the back yard as fast as her
baby legs could carry her.</p>
<p>After telling Dona Marina just what
I thought of her conduct, I went after
the baby, and finally caught her. But,
when I brought her back to the street,
there was no mother bird anywhere to
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
be seen or heard, and she evidently
thought her darling had gone down Dona
Marina&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>I then told the little stranger that she
was in the hands of the head nurse of
&ldquo;The Bird Hospital,&rdquo; and would receive
the best of care. I at once put
her into a nice little cot, and covered her,
as it is best to keep wild or strange birds
in the dark for at least two days, until
they get used to you and their environments.</p>
<p>My new patient was very hungry, so
I had no trouble in getting her to take
the cracker soaked in milk. The third
day I put her into a canary cage (but
covered), as I thought I better try and
teach her to stay in a cage some of the
time, and not always have her liberty,
as the dear departed Cady did. She
behaved unusually well, and I kept her
in that for several days, taking her out
many times to stretch and flop her wings.</p>
<p>I was then fortunate enough to have
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
a large parrot cage loaned me. She
showed great delight when I put her in,
as she had plenty of room to go about,
and did not show the slightest desire to
get out. I knew she could if she wished,
as the brass wires were very wide apart.</p>
<p>I was detained down-stairs, and it was
later than usual when I went up to put
her to bed in her cot. As I went into
the room, I saw there was no baby bird
in the cage.</p>
<p>I called out: &ldquo;Oh, my baby has
gone,&rdquo; and a very mournful peep came
back to me, which plainly said: &ldquo;I am
over here in this dark corner.&rdquo; She had
evidently tried to find me, but did not
know the way down-stairs. That was
the first and last time she ever ran away.</p>
<p>Blondell and Dona Marina had been
the only occupants in the hospital for
three years, with the exception of a few
stray patients who only lived a very short
time.</p>
<p>At first Dona Marina did not know
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
what to make of the robin. She knew it
was entirely different from Blondell,
and watched it hopping all over the floor
with the greatest interest, as Blondell
usually stayed in her cage. For a few
days I watched her very carefully when
the robin was on the floor, but she soon
understood she was not to touch it, and
would lie on the rug and go to sleep,
while the robin played about her.</p>
<p>Two weeks after I rescued the robin
from the jaws of death, I saw another
baby robin in the back yard. The floodgates
of heaven were opened wide, and
the rain coming down in perfect torrents.
I could not see or hear any father
or mother bird, but there was a large
white cat who had his eyes upon her. I
spent most of my time for an hour with
one eye on the bird and the other on the
cat. At last I succeeded in frightening
the cat away, and, as it grew dark, the
bird flew up on to the grape-vine, then
into a small tree. It had not stopped
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
raining one minute, and I could not bear
to think of that dear baby up in a tree
all night alone, with a prospect of the
white cat making his breakfast upon it.</p>
<p>When it became quite dark, I took a
chair out under the tree, stood up on it,
reached up and put my hand over the
bird. I soon found it had good lungs,
and also found it was a beauty, so did
not mind being covered with mud and
getting almost as wet as the bird. I felt
sure it was a male bird, and that the first
one was a female, as that was so much
lighter in colouring.</p>
<p>I dried orphan number two, and put
him to sleep in a cot, just as I did orphan
number one. The next morning I told
her all that I have told to you, then
brought the little stranger and put him
inside the cage, expecting she would be
more than pleased to have a relative for
a companion, but, alas, no. I never was
more mistaken in my life. She put up
all the feathers in her crest, looking like
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
a wild &ldquo;Indian,&rdquo; spread her wings, and
was not only ready to fight, but pitched
right in. The little stranger was more
afraid of her than he was of the white
cat, and it did not take him many seconds
to get out between the bars, and
fly to me for protection. But, after a
few days, they became good friends, and
slept every night in the cage side by side
in the swing.</p>
<p>Then came a great discussion, &ldquo;What
shall I name the robins?&rdquo; but it was settled
for me by having the little book I
spoke of sent me.</p>
<p>When Dona Marina saw robin number
two, she acted as if she thought there
were getting to be more robins in the
hospital than she cared to see, but when
number three arrived, her eyes grew
larger than ever, and she seemed to say:
&ldquo;Will they never cease coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was unusually busy when a friend
came with a box. I said: &ldquo;I hope you
have not brought anything for me to
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
take care of, as I am almost frantic
now.&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;Only a baby robin.&rdquo;
I held up my hands and exclaimed:
&ldquo;But I already have two.&rdquo; She said:
&ldquo;I did not know what else to do with
it. It fell out of the nest, and I could
not take care of it, and I knew you
would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor little thing could not even
stand up, and all it knew was to open
its big bill and cry for food. Of course
I was simply obliged to keep it.</p>
<p>Few people have the slightest idea of
the care and trouble of a wild baby bird.
I did not want it to starve to death, so
every few moments I put cracker and
milk down that yawning cavity. The
last thing before I got into bed at twelve
o&rsquo;clock I fed it, and I got up and fed
it every two hours during the night. I
was almost in hopes it might die, but,
when morning came, it was as lively as
a cricket. I at once named the third
orphan B&egrave;b&egrave;, and for two weeks it gave
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
to me the greatest pleasure, as well as
constant care.</p>
<p>Bobbinette and Bobby simply hated
the little stranger, and would not have
the slightest thing to do with her. If
I put her into their cage, they would
immediately chase her out. She would
fall on to the floor, as she could not fly,
and get out of their way as quickly as
her weak little legs could carry her.
Every little while during the day, I
would put her into her little white cot
for a nap, and she would go to sleep at
once.</p>
<p>Every day she grew stronger, and before
many days could run about as fast
as Bobbinette and Bobby, but she could
not fly.</p>
<p>At that time Dona Marina gave birth
to two beautiful kittens, consequently
she was in the hospital most of the day
as well as the night. At first I was
afraid Dona Marina might hurt B&egrave;b&egrave;,
as B&egrave;b&egrave; could not fly, and was usually
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
on the floor when she was not taking her
nap.</p>
<p>All there was to do was to make Dona
Marina fully understand she was not to
hurt or even frighten B&egrave;b&egrave;.</p>
<p>I put Dona Marina on a chair, then
put B&egrave;b&egrave; beside her. By the way Bobbinette
and Bobby cocked their pretty
heads and puffed out their breasts, I
knew they were thoroughly enjoying
hearing me tell Dona Marina how very
naughty they had been to B&egrave;b&egrave;, and that
she must be very kind to the little
stranger, help take good care of her, and
make her happy. Dona Marina nodded
her wise little head, and blinked her intelligent
eyes at me, smelled B&egrave;b&egrave; all
over, but never offered to bite her. In
cat language she said she would always
be kind, and try to take the place of
her lost mother, and she kept her promise.
From that day they were together
almost constantly, Dona Marina lying
on a chair or on the floor (when she was
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
not giving her babies their dinner, as it
was too warm weather to stay with them
all the time), with B&egrave;b&egrave; playing all about
her.</p>
<p>When Bobbinette and Bobby felt very
good-natured, they would ask B&egrave;b&egrave; to
play with them on the floor, but never
would let her go inside their cage. If
Dona Marina was trying to take a nap,
they would hop all about her, chirp as
loud as they could, and tell B&egrave;b&egrave; to go
and pull her tail, which she often did.
Dona Marina would open her eyes, smile
at her, close them, give a good stretch,
and go to sleep again.</p>
<p>When B&egrave;b&egrave; would hear Dona Marina
and me coming up the stairs, she would
run out into the hall to meet us, hop
along by Dona Marina&rsquo;s side into the
dressing-room, hop on to the edge of her
dish, and drink milk with her, and Dona
Marina never gave her a cross look.</p>
<p>We feel sure if B&egrave;b&egrave; had lived until
the cot with the kittens in it was put
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
on the floor, she would have gotten right
in and gone to sleep with them. But
dear B&egrave;b&egrave;&rsquo;s life was far too short for
me, but plenty long for Bobbinette and
Bobby.</p>
<p>One afternoon while I was out, B&egrave;b&egrave;
must have felt badly, and went down-stairs
to look for me. She found her
way into my mother&rsquo;s room and woke
her with her peeping. My mother spoke
to her, but she knew it was not the voice
she was accustomed to, and tried to find
her way back. She was dreadfully
frightened when she was finally caught,
for she also knew it was not the hand
that fondled her. When I returned, I
saw at once there was something wrong
with my baby bird, as a very bad odour
was coming from her breath. I did all
I could, put her to bed, and she seemed
all right. The next morning she grew
worse again, and in a few moments was
nothing but a ball of pretty lifeless
feathers. I felt sure she died of blood
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
poison from the angleworms that were
forced down her throat before she was
brought to the hospital. The mother
birds always kill the worms before feeding
to their birdlings.</p>
<p>After Bobbinette had been in the hospital
a week, as a great honour, I presented
Cady&rsquo;s blue and white china bath-dish
to her. She acknowledged the compliment
by going right in and taking a
nice bath. When Bobby arrived, he did
not even wait to be asked to make use
of the bath-tub, but took possession at
once. After that, Bobbinette positively
refused to take her bath in it. Every
day when I offered it to her, she would
hop on to the edge, then fly away, go
into the cage, scold, and try to make me
understand what she meant. If I held
the dish up to her, she would hop on,
take a drink, and away she would go.</p>
<p>This went on for two weeks, then all
at once it flashed through my stupid
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
brain that she had no intention of taking
a bath in the same dish Bobby did.</p>
<p>I immediately went down-stairs, and
came back with an oval white vegetable
dish, and said: &ldquo;Bobbinette, how would
you like this for your very own?&rdquo; She
was wild with delight, and could hardly
wait until it was filled; in fact, got in
before the water was put in. I assure
you she took a good long bath to make
up for the two weeks she had been without.</p>
<p>The next morning, when I put the
blue dish down for Bob and the white
one for Bobbinette, that impertinent and
presuming fellow had the face to go over
to Bobbinette&rsquo;s dish and say: &ldquo;I think
I will try the white one for a change,&rdquo;
and hopped on with a very grand air;
but he hopped off much quicker than he
hopped on, for Bobbinette flew at him
and took feathers out of the top of his
head. When she sees him, she will never
let him go near her dish, but often she
does not see him, and, if I am not there,
he will take part of his bath in hers, then
the rest in his own.</p>
<div class="img" id="pica7">
<img src="images/i167.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="500" />
<p class="caption">BOBBINETTE<span class="hst10"> BOBBY</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>Lately I have made it a point to be
there until he finishes, for I cannot supply
a new dish for Bobbinette every few
days.</p>
<p>They like to have me play with them
by throwing the water at them, just as
Cady did, and, if I sing and keep time
by rapping the dish, Bob will sing with
me.</p>
<p>Bob would take a bath twice a day
if I would let him, but Bobbinette sometimes
does not take one for two or three
days. You see she got into bad habits
the weeks she went without.</p>
<p>It had rained most of the time before
Bobbinette and Bobby came to the hospital
to live, and no doubt they had been
soaked to the skin many times. When
it was too late, I found I ought not to
have let them bathe, for they both had
bad colds. I did not know what the
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
matter was until they began to cough,
sneeze, and make all sorts of disagreeable
noises. They would have driven any one
who was nervous about wild, and they
really annoyed me, who am not, and kept
me awake many nights. I had never had
birds act as they did, for they were different
from a bird with the asthma.
Some of my friends who knew about
chickens said they had the &ldquo;pip,&rdquo; others
the &ldquo;gapes,&rdquo; and told me to do this, that,
and the other thing, but they kept growing
worse instead of better. Finally I
wrote to my old standby, George
Holden, and asked what to do, as I felt
it was high time to have a good counsel.
They had already been eating his bird
food. He wrote to me: &ldquo;Do not pay
any attention to the noise the robins
make, add more carrot to their food, give
them plenty of green food, and let them
have all they want to eat; keep them
warm, and they will come out all right.&rdquo;
I followed his advice, and, after many
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
trying weeks, they entirely recovered.
This case was the longest, except Teddy&rsquo;s,
the hospital ever had.</p>
<p>When Bobby moulted, his feathers
came in as fast as they came out, but
Bobbinette must have had a high fever,
for, when some of hers came out, no new
ones came in. From her shoulders to
the top of her head she did not have a
feather for two months. She would
scratch her head and pick her wings most
of the time.</p>
<p>One day I looked her over carefully,
and found the under part of her wings
red and inflamed, while on the top of her
head was a crust similar to the milk crust
babies have.</p>
<p>I immediately rubbed dry sulphur all
over her head and under parts of her
wings, and kept it up for two weeks.
By the time it was warm weather, and
their colds seemed cured, I let them have
their bath again, and how much they
enjoyed them only they can tell. Then
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
the crust began to leave Bobbinette&rsquo;s
head, as well as all of her crest feathers,
until only three remained, and for weeks
no new ones came in. It was very amusing,
when Bobbinette became very angry
and began to scold, to see those three
feathers stand straight up as proud as if
there were three dozen.</p>
<p>Bobby is always dignified and rarely
loses his temper or ruffles his plumage,
while Bobbinette very often gets mad,
scolds you, strutting about with breast
feathers all puffed out, and the feathers
on her head standing up and her tail
going like a little wren. If Bobby is
taking a drink of water, and Bobbinette
wants some, she never says, &ldquo;By your
leave,&rdquo; or waits a second, but coolly takes
him by the feathers of his head and puts
him away, and takes possession of the
water. But Bob is much more destructive
than Bobbinette. They eat off of
pretty Vantine china, and drank their
water out of thin whiskey glasses until
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
Bob broke four by taking them up in
his bill and dropping them down on his
bath-dish to hear them make a ringing
sound. Now I make them use a little
earthen jar, that is good and strong, and
only favour them with a glass to drink
their milk out of when they go down to
the parlour for their singing lesson.</p>
<p>One day Bob took a lovely china pin-tray
off of my dressing-table and threw
it on the floor, breaking it in many
pieces. Another day I found him out
in the hall with my string of gold beads,
shaking them as if he thought they were
an angleworm. He had bitten two
beads until they were almost flat. Like
many small boys, he thinks matches are
about the nicest things to play with, and
I often find them thrown in all directions.</p>
<p>Dona Marina&rsquo;s kittens had been given
away before they were old enough to
take much notice of Blondell, but her
new kittens, Blonde and Brunette, lived
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
with the birds many weeks. Blonde was
white with tortoise-shell markings, and
twice as large as Brunette, who was just
like her black mother.</p>
<p>Blonde was gentle in all of her ways,
while Brunette was just the opposite.
Blonde would wake me in the morning
by gently tapping my cheek with her big,
soft white paw. Brunette would come
with a rush and land on the top of my
head. I did not have the least trouble
in teaching Blonde not to spring at the
birds, but I had a great deal with Brunette
before I could make her understand
that she was not to slap them with
her tiny black velvet paw.</p>
<p>One day I was really surprised myself
when I went into the room to find Blonde
sound asleep in front of Blondell&rsquo;s cage
on the platform, Brunette asleep in the
gravel, and Bobbinette and Bobby on the
perches above them. It proved they had
learned their lessons well, and I never
worried about them after that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>I was very anxious to get a picture
of them altogether, so had the old perches
brought up that had been put away so
long. For a week I posed them every
day. Dona Marina on &ldquo;Teddy&rsquo;s piazza,&rdquo;
Blonde in the side with the food,
Brunette in the gravel, Bobbinette and
Bobby on the perches, and Blondell in
her usual place. It made a pretty picture,
I assure you.</p>
<p>The photographer was very busy, and
by the time he could come, it was impossible
to have Dona Marina in the group,
as she had weaned her babies and hated
every hair in their dear little bodies.
For two weeks she did nothing but growl
and spit every time she saw them, besides
slapping them hard if they came
within her reach. Brunette would slap
back, but lovable little Blonde would look
at her in a sad, astonished way.</p>
<p>One day, when Dona Marina came in
and could not find her babies, after looking
all over the lower part of the house,
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
she fairly beamed, and we never heard
another growl, but it was many weeks
before she went to the hospital.</p>
<p>One day I tried carrying her up, but
she fought so hard I had to let her go.
I tried again, and got her inside and
put her on the bed. She smelled it all
over, then simply flew out, and down-stairs
she went. The next time when I
got her inside, I closed the door. When
she found she could not get out, she examined
every corner, went under everything,
and, when she finally made up her
mind there were no kittens hidden away,
she jumped into my lap and began to
sing. She wants to be all in all to me,
and is jealous of everything and everybody.</p>
<p>But to go back to the picture, that was
a day long to be remembered. When
I asked the photographer to take it, he
looked at me as if he thought I had just
escaped from a lunatic hospital, and said:
&ldquo;I can take a picture of a bird or a cat,
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
but to take one of birds and cats together,
I think it would be quite impossible.&rdquo;
I was determined if possible to have the
picture taken, so said: &ldquo;But you do not
know me, my cats, or my birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last he came to please me, not expecting
to get any kind of a picture. I
told him to come right after luncheon,
as Blonde and Brunette were sleepy at
that time, but instead, it was between
four and five o&rsquo;clock. Bobbinette and
Bob had only been used to our boy coming
into the hospital, so, when two men
appeared, it was quite enough to frighten
the wits out of them, but their bringing
all of their machines made it ten times
worse. They flew here, there, and everywhere,
out into the hall, back again,
lighting upon my head and shoulders.
It took a long time to get them quiet,
but the men made as little noise as possible,
and were very patient.</p>
<p>After Bobbinette and Bobby became
a little used to them, I looked up Blonde
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
and Brunette. They were just fresh
from their nap, and wanted to do anything
but mind and sit still. Several
times I thought it was going to be even
beyond me to get them all quiet at once.</p>
<p>At last it was accomplished. Bang!
went the machine, vivid light, dense
smoke, Bobbinette and Bobby flying in
every direction and screeching as only
robins can; Blonde and Brunette running
all over the floor, growling, spitting,
and hissing, but the deed was done.
When we saw the picture, we all felt
repaid for our trouble, and the birds and
kittens for being so frightened. And the
photographer, by the way, found after
all that he could take a picture of birds
and kittens together.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of quite a
little work, which took a great deal of
time, nervous strength, and patience,
but with it all we derived a great deal
of pleasure, and the birds seemed to thoroughly
enjoy being naughty.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Just at this time a young Italian came
to town, fresh from a school of photography,
who had plenty of time to give
to us. His kindness and patience was
fully appreciated and never will be forgotten.
The birds liked him, too, as he
was always gentle, spoke kindly, and
never a cross word did we hear, no matter
how provoking they were. The group
with Bobbinette and Bobby, Dick, Dona
Marina, Blondell and me took two whole
evenings to get.</p>
<p>Just as the photographer would think
they were all in good position, Bobbinette
would turn her back; then, when
she turned around, Bobby would get
down and go out into the back parlour.
As no one could manage them but me,
I would have to get up, taking Dick and
Blondell in my left hand, Dona Marina
under my left arm, and go after Bobby.
Dona Marina did not care how many
birds were on her back if she could lie
on my lap, but Blondell was as slippery
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
as an eel, and, when all the others were
ready, off from Dona Marina&rsquo;s back she
would go, and I would have to get down
again and go after her, holding tight
to Dick and Dona Marina.</p>
<p>One day during summer we had a
patient the like of which we had never
had before. It was a wee brown puppy,
but where she came from we never found
out. Her coming was heralded by Dona
Marina&rsquo;s jumping on to her back and
slapping and biting her. The birds and
I rushed to the window when we heard
the noise; the puppy was crying lustily,
as she was too young to fight. The next
thing they came tearing into the hospital,
and for a few moments one would have
thought the room was filled with wild
animals.</p>
<p>For two days there was constant trouble
and commotion in the hospital, and
I felt if I did not find her a good home
(which I did), all of my patients would
have nervous prostration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Another day the robins were very
much frightened by an English sparrow
coming to the hospital. If it had been
a large hawk, they could not have acted
worse. A man brought him, who had
taken him away from a cruel boy who
was just ready to give him to his cat.
I looked him all over, and, when I found
he was not injured in any way, I knew
it would not be right to keep him. I
would have liked to, as he reminded me
so much of Mack. When I opened the
window, he flew out, chirping loudly, and
I have not a doubt he told his friends
many tales of his narrow escape, about
the place where he had been, and the
things he had seen.</p>
<p>One day a little girl three years old
came to visit me. As she stood in the
door looking at the birds, she certainly
looked like a fairy direct from Fairyland,
all dressed in white, with the whitest
skin, cheeks like the pinkest roses, blue
eyes like wood-violets, and curls like the
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
brightest of gold. But Bobbinette and
Bobby did not appreciate the picture, for
they never were more frightened in their
lives, and it was hours before they became
used to her.</p>
<p>Dona Marina always knew when it was
five o&rsquo;clock, and time for Bobbinette and
Bobby to have their supper of cracker
and milk, and she would bring Blonde
and Brunette and sit down in front of
me, while Bobbinette and Bobby perched
on the edge of the box, and I would give
them each a piece as well as the birds.
Then I taught them to sit up on their
haunches like little bears and eat their
crackers.</p>
<p>Blonde would often take her piece in
one paw and eat it, and Brunette would
take hers in both paws and put it into
her mouth, while Dona Marina would sit
up very straight with her little paws bent,
and look first at one kitten, then at the
other in a very proud way.</p>
<p>Now Bobbinette and Bobby have
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
reached the dignity of having a little
doll&rsquo;s table and a chair of their own.
They will stand up on their chairs and
eat whatever I give them off of little
butter-plates. If a meal worm is served,
it is as good to them as a turkey dinner
is to any of us.</p>
<p>Bobby was much more precocious with
his singing than Cady. I worked many
weeks with Cady before he would make
a sound, but Bob began at once and has
improved every day since.</p>
<p>One day late in the fall I took him
down just to see if he would be afraid
of the piano, but he was not in the least,
and began to sing very softly. I meant
to have looked up some new music for
him, but he was ready before I was, so
I began with the same old things Cady
sung, and he seemed to like them just
as well as Cady did. I have added to
his repertoire that pretty little waltz
song, &ldquo;Love Comes Like a Summer
Dream,&rdquo; from the old opera, &ldquo;Little
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
Tycoon,&rdquo; another waltz song, &ldquo;I am Going
Far Away, Love,&rdquo; two parts from
&ldquo;When the Leaves Begin to Fall,&rdquo; and
a sweet lullaby.</p>
<p>A friend, who is a professional singer,
came to hear him sing. I said to her:
&ldquo;I want you to listen to every note and
tell me honestly just what you think of
him.&rdquo; He sang for a half-hour, only
stopping while I changed the music.
When we finished, she said: &ldquo;I do not
know which is the most marvellous, the
pupil or the teacher. He is simply wonderful,
never makes one discord, keeps
perfect time, and carries the air as near
as possible, and the little trills he puts
in are simply bewitching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lullaby he sings as soft and low
as I do. What kind of a singer I am
going to make of Bobbinette, time alone
can tell. She will sing with me a little
every morning up-stairs, but only twice
have I been able to get her to sing down-stairs.
I bring her down every day after
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
Bob has had his singing lesson. Although
she is such a fighter, she is very
timid and nervous when down-stairs if
there is any one there. She usually
comes down on my shoulder, and I can
feel every nerve in her body quiver as
I lay my cheek against her.</p>
<p>When Bobbinette appears, Bob knows
his lesson is over and that he can do as
he pleases. He will go all over both
rooms, perch on anything he sees fit, sing
a little in a very low voice, come and look
at Bobbinette and stand beside her on
the perch. I have not given up getting
them to sing a duet together. When
Bobbinette sings up-stairs, Bob stops
short, stands on one leg, and listens to
her with a look as much as to say:
&ldquo;What are you trying to sing for? I
am the singer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Bobbinette is a good listener, I
still have hopes of her. She is so pretty
and still keeps her baby look, and when
she listens she cocks her head on one
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
side and looks so interested, and will puff
out her breast and open her bill as wide
as she can. For a treat after their lesson,
they have some sugar wafers. They
prefer the champagne ones, as they have
more chocolate in them. They get on
my shoulder and take the wafer out of
my mouth. Then they have milk (which
they love) in a whiskey glass. Some
days they have two or three Zante currants,
of which they are very fond.</p>
<p>My mother has all of her meals served
in the back parlour, and it is a great
treat for Bobbinette and Bobby to have
their singing lesson before luncheon, then
they stay down until afterward.</p>
<p>They will not make friends with any
one but me, but they will get as near
my mother as they dare, and see what
she has to eat, but will not take anything
from her.</p>
<p>I was very much frightened the other
day to see a hair sticking out of Bobbinette&rsquo;s
bill. I was more frightened
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
when I pulled out an eighth of a yard
and could get no more, as it seemed to
be wound around the lower part of her
tongue. It was rather a difficult task
to hold the bird, take a magnifying glass,
and open the bill and look down. After
a half-hour&rsquo;s work at the hair, gently
pulling it from side to side, it became
loose and came out. The next day Bob
came to me holding one leg up. As I
looked at him, I thought he in some way
had gotten a rubber band around his leg.
You can imagine my surprise, when I
took him in my hand, to find, instead of
a rubber band, his hind claw was wound
around his leg and caught with the nail.
How it ever got that way, I have not the
least idea.</p>
<p>As I entered my room the other afternoon,
I saw a picture that any artist
might have been proud to paint. Dona
Marina was lying stretched out full
length on the foot of my bed, with her
new baby kittens, Scozza and Fava, lying
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
beside her; all were in Dreamland. On
the brass rod at the foot perched Bobbinette
and Bobby, the latter singing at
the top of his voice, while Bobbinette
listened.</p>
<p>I feel sure if John Burroughs knew
my birds, he would change his mind
about birds not thinking and reasoning.</p>
<p>Many people know birds and their
habits in a wild state, but really know
nothing of them as pets in the house.</p>
<p>I am told Mr. Burroughs does
not advocate domesticating wild birds;
neither do I, if they are old, well, and
strong, but, on the contrary, if they are
injured, and are only easy prey for
small boys and cats, I firmly believe in
taking them in and making them happy,
which I think I have always succeeded
in doing.</p>
<p>I have often taken birds in, expecting
to let them go when they were large
enough, but they simply would not, for
they knew they would not know how to
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
take care of themselves or hunt their
food. For instance, if I had not brought
Bobbinette and Bobby in, they would
have been killed, and it would be very
cruel to turn them out now after the
luxurious lives they have lived for eleven
months; besides, they are perfectly well,
and happy as the day is long, and know
no other life.</p>
<p>My pets are a great care, but the pleasure
I receive from them more than recompenses
me. I only hope you will all
be so interested in my little sketches that
you will &ldquo;cry for more,&rdquo; and then I
shall be able to stop your crying.</p>
